NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>And they took their journey from Elim, and all    
the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin,     
which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after 
their departing out of the land of Egypt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

unto them, Would to we had died by the hand of YHVH in the land of Egypt, when  
we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have    
brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with         
hunger.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Then   
said YHVH unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the    
people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, 
whether they will walk in my law, or no.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as   
they gather daily.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then  
ye shall know that YHVH hath brought you out from the land of Egypt:</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And in the morning,    
then ye shall see the glory of YHVH; for that he heareth your murmurings        
against YHVH: and what are we, that ye murmur against us?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses said, This shall be, when 
YHVH shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to    
the full; for that YHVH heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him:    
and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against YHVH.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses spake unto   
Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near       
before YHVH: for he hath heard your murmurings.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the 
whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the       
wilderness, and, behold, the glory of YHVH appeared in the cloud.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH spake unto       
Moses, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them,      
saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with  
bread; and ye shall know that I am YHVH your ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, that at even 
the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round  
about the host.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the          
wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the     
ground.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for  
they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which    
YHVH hath given you to eat.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>    
16</H4></TD><TD><P>This is the thing which YHVH hath commanded, Gather of it    
every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the      
number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his tents.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And the         
children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they did mete it     
with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered      
little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses said, Let  
no man leave of it till the morning.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses;  
but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank:    
and Moses was wroth with them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4> 
21</H4></TD><TD><P>And they gathered it every morning, every man according to   
his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, that on the  
sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the 
rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, This is that which    
YHVH hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto YHVH: bake that  
which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which       
remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And they laid it up till the  
morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm        
therein.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto YHVH: to day ye shall 
not find it in the field.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>      
26</H4></TD><TD><P>Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which   
is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, that there went out some   
of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH said unto   
Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>See, for that YHVH hath given 
you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two      
days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the    
seventh day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>
So the people rested on the seventh day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And the house of Israel called the name thereof 
Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like      
wafers made with honey.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And Moses said, This is the thing which YHVH commandeth, Fill an

wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the   
land of Egypt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna         
therein, and lay it up before YHVH, to be kept for your generations.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>As YHVH commanded    
Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And the children of Israel    
did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat    
manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>Now an omer is the tenth part
