ye may grow thereby:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>If so be ye have tasted that YHVH is gracious.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>To whom coming, as unto a living    
stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of ELOHIYM, and precious,</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye also, as lively     
stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up         
spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to ELOHIYM by YAHSHUA MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore also it is        
contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect,  
precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Unto you therefore which

builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And a stone of stumbling, and a

whereunto also they were appointed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9> 
<H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an

who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light;</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Which in time past were not a

now have obtained mercy.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain    
from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Having your conversation honest among the    
Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your   
good works, which they shall behold, glorify ELOHIYM in the day of              
visitation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for YHVH's sake: whether it be to   
the king, as supreme;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the        
punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>For so is the will of     
ELOHIYM, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish    
men:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>As      
free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the       
servants of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear ELOHIYM. Honour the      
king.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>       
Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and    
gentle, but also to the froward.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19>   
<H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward  
ELOHIYM endure grief, suffering wrongfully.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted   
for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and       
suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with ELOHIYM.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>For even hereunto    
were ye called: because MASHIYACH also suffered for us, leaving us an example,  
that ye should follow his steps:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22>   
<H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Who, when he    
was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but        
committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Who his own self bare our sins in 
his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto         
righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>For ye were as sheep going astray; but are   
now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
