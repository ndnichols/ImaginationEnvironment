<TD><P>Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came 
unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain    
others with them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And they entered in, and found  
not the body of the ADONAY YAHSHUA.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4> 
<H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed          
thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And as they were afraid, and    
bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the       
living among the dead?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when   
he was yet in Galilee,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful   
men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And they remembered his words,</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And returned from 
the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the        
rest.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>It was 
Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that   
were with them, which told these things unto the apostles.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And their words seemed to them as 
idle tales, and they believed them not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre;   
and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and          
departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And, behold, two of them went 
that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about        
threescore furlongs.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to  
pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, YAHSHUA himself drew     
near, and went with them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>      
16</H4></TD><TD><P>But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said     
unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, 
as ye walk, and are sad?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto    
him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which 
are come to pass there in these days?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, What things? And they    
said unto him, Concerning YAHSHUA of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in    
deed and word before ELOHIYM and all the people:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And how the chief priests and our 
rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>But we trusted that  
it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day   
is the third day since these things were done.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Yea, and certain women also of our company   
made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they found not his body, 
they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that  
he was alive.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it   
even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Then he said unto them, O fools,  
and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>Ought not MASHIYACH to    
have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And beginning at Moses and all    
the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things           
concerning himself.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as   
though he would have gone further.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29> 
<H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it  
is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with       
them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And it 
came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and   
brake, and gave to them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out  
of their sight.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he     
talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And they rose up the 
same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together,   
and them that were with them,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>  
34</H4></TD><TD><P>Saying, The ADONAY is risen indeed, and hath appeared to     
Simon.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in     
breaking of bread.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And as they thus spake, YAHSHUA himself stood in the midst of them, and  
saith unto them, Peace be unto you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37>
<H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed     
that they had seen a spirit.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>   
38</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do       
thoughts arise in your hearts?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4> 
39</H4></TD><TD><P>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, 
and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he had thus      
spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>And while they yet believed not for joy, and 
wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>And they gave him a piece of a    
broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43> 
<H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>And he took it, and did eat before them.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them,    
These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all  
things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the    
prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P>Then opened he their understanding, that they   
might understand the scriptures,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46>   
<H4>46</H4></TD><TD><P>And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it      
behoved MASHIYACH to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>47</H4></TD><TD><P>And that repentance  
and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations,         
beginning at Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V48><H4>48</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And ye are witnesses of these things.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V49><H4>49</H4></TD><TD><P>And, behold, I send the promise   
of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be       
endued with power from ELYOWN.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V50><H4> 
50</H4></TD><TD><P>And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up   
his hands, and blessed them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V51><H4>   
51</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted    
from them, and carried up into heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V52><H4>52</H4></TD><TD><P>And they worshipped him, and returned to        
Jerusalem with great joy:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V53><H4>      
53</H4></TD><TD><P>And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing    
ELOHIYM. Amen.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John
