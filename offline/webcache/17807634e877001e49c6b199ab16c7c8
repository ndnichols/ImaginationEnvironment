<p>1. A&#346;VINS, what praise may win your grace? Who may be pleasing to you both?<br> How shall the ignorant worship you?<br> 2 Here let the ignorant ask the means of you who know&#151;for none beside you knoweth aught&#151;<br> Not of a spiritless mortal man.<br> 3 Such as ye: are, all-wise, we call you. Ye wise, declare to us this day accepted prayer.<br> Loving you well your servant lauds you.<br> 4 Simply, ye Mighty Ones, I ask the Gods of that wondrous oblation hallowed by the mystic word.<br> Save us from what is stronger, fiercer than ourselves.<br> 5 Forth go the hymn that shone in Gho&#7779;&#257; Bh&#7771;gu's like, the song wherewith the son of Pajra worships you,<br> Like some wise minister.<br> 6 Hear ye the song of him who hastens speedily. O A&#347;vins, I am he who sang your praise.<br> Hither, ye Lords of Splendour, hither turn your eyes.<br> 7 For ye were ever nigh to deal forth ample wealth, to give the wealth that ye had gathered up.<br> As such, ye Vasus, guard us well, and keep us safely from the wicked wolf.<br> 8 Give us not up to any man who hateth us, nor let our milch-cows stray, whose udders give us food,<br> Far from our homes without their calves.<br> 9 May they who love you gain you for their Friends. Prepare ye us for opulence with strengthening food,<br> Prepare us for the food that floweth from our cows<br> 10 I have obtained the horseless car of A&#347;vins rich in sacrifice,<br> And I am well content therewith.<br> 11 May it convey me evermore: may the light chariot pass from men<br> To men unto the Soma draught.<br> 12 It holdeth slumber in contempt. and the rich who enjoyeth not:<br> Both vanish quickly and are lost.</p>
