<p>1. PRIEST of our rite, stand up erect, O Agni, in the Gods&#146; service best of sacrificers,<br> For over evei y thought thou art the Ruler: thou furtherest e&#146;en the wisdom of the pious.<br> 2 He was set down mid men as Priest unerring, Agni, wise, welcome in our holy synods.<br> Like Savitar he hath lifted up his splendour, and like a builder raised his smoke to heaven.<br> 3 The glowing ladle, filled with oil, is lifted; choosing Gods&#146; service to the right he circles.<br> Eager he rises like the new-wrought pillar which, firmly set and fixed, anoints the victims.<br> 4 When sacred grass is strewn and Agni kindled, the Adhvaryu rises to, his task rejoicing.<br> Agni the Priest, like one who tends the cattle, goes three times round, as from of old he wills it.<br> 5 Agni himself, the Priest, with measured motion, goes round, with sweet speech, cheerful, true to Order.<br> His fulgent flames run forth like vigorous horses; all creatures are affrighted when he blazes.<br> 6 Beautiful and auspicious is thine aspect, O lovely Agni, terrible when spreading.<br> Thy splendours are not covered by the darkness: detraction leaves no stain upon thy body.<br> 7 Naught hindered his production, Bounteous Giver: his Mother and his Sire were free to send him.<br> Then as Friend benevolent, refulgent, Agni shone forth in human habitations.<br> 8 He, Agni, whom the twice-five sisters, dwelling together, in the homes of men engendered,<br> Bright like a spear's tooth, wakened in the morning, with powerful mouth and like an axe well-sharpened.<br> 9 These thy Bay Coursers, Agni, dropping fatness, ruddy vigorous, speeding straightly forward,<br> And red steeds, wonderful, of mighty muscle, are to this service of the Gods invited:<br> 10 These brightly-shining games of thine, O Agni, that move for ever restless, all-subduing,<br> Like falcons hasting eagerly to the quarry, roar loudly like the army of the Maruts.<br> 11 To thee, O flaming God, hath prayer been offered. Let the priest laud thee: give to him who worships.<br> Men have established Agni as Invoker, fain to adore the glory of the living.</p>
