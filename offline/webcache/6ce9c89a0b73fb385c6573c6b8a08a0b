<TD><P>The beginning of the gospel of YAHSHUA MASHIYACH, the Son of ELOHIYM;</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>As it is written  
in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall       
prepare thy way before thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>    
3</H4></TD><TD><P>The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way 
of YHVH, make his paths straight.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4>   
<H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the        
baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And there went out unto him all the 
land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the      
river of Jordan, confessing their sins.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with  
a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And preached,     
saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I 
am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>I indeed have baptized you with water: but he     
shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass in those days, that YAHSHUA   
came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And straightway coming up 
out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove         
descending upon him:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved     
Son, in whom I am well pleased.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>
12</H4></TD><TD><P>And immediately the spirit driveth him into the              
wilderness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with   
the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Now after that John was put in    
prison, YAHSHUA came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of       
EL,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And      
saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of EL is at hand: repent ye, and 
believe the gospel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his      
brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA said unto them, Come  
ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And straightway they forsook      
their nets, and followed him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>  
19</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James   
the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending     
their nets.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship  
with the hired servants, and went after him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And they went into Capernaum; and straightway   
on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And they were astonished at   
his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the      
scribes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Saying, Let us  
alone; what have we to do with thee, thou YAHSHUA of Nazareth? art thou come to 
destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the CHACIYD of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA rebuked him,      
saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and   
cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And they were all amazed, insomuch that they    
questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is   
this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do    
obey him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about    
Galilee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the      
house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a      
fever, and anon they tell him of her.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And he came and took her by the hand, and       
lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto      
them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And at 
even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and   
them that were possessed with devils.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And all the city was gathered together at the   
door.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>And he 
healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and    
suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And in the morning, rising up a   
great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and    
there prayed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they had found him,  
they said unto him, All men seek for thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, Let us go into the next  
towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>And he preached in their  
synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>And there came a leper to him,    
beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt,    
thou canst make me clean.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>      
41</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and  
touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>And as soon as he had spoken,     
immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>And he straitly charged   
him, and forthwith sent him away;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44>  
<H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but 
go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those       
things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P>But he went out, and began to     
publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that YAHSHUA could no 
more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they     
came to him from every quarter.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
