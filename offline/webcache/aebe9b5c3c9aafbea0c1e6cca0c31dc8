Chapter 18</H1></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that 
the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as 
his own soul.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's   
house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Then    
Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And Jonathan      
stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his   
garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And David went out          
whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over  
the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in 
the sight of Saul's servants.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>   
6</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned     
from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of  
Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and     
with instruments of music.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul   
hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And Saul was very wroth, and the    
saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten           
thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have     
more but the kingdom?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass on the        
morrow, that the evil spirit from ELOHIYM came upon Saul, and he prophesied in  
the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and  
there was a javelin in Saul's hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11>
<H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite     
David even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And Saul was    
afraid of David, because YHVH was with him, and was departed from Saul.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore Saul       
removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out 
and came in before the people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4> 
14</H4></TD><TD><P>And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and YHVH   
was with him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid   
of him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>But  
all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before        
them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to     
wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight YHVH's battles. For Saul said, Let 
not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And David said  
unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that 
I should be son in law to the king?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19>
<H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's        
daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the    
Meholathite to wife.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the 
thing pleased him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and  
that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to     
David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And Saul commanded   
his servants, saying, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king    
hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the      
king's son in law.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David    
said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law, seeing that I  
am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On   
this manner spake David.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not    
any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the    
king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the          
Philistines.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>
And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the   
king's son in law: and the days were not expired.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore David arose and went,   
he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought  
their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be  
the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And Saul saw and     
knew that YHVH was with David, and that Michal Saul's daughter loved him.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And Saul was    
yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David's enemy continually.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the        
princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went     
forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so 
that his name was much set by.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
