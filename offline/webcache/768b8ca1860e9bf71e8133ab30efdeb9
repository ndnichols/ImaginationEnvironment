<p>1. COME hither, Maruts, on your lightning laden cars, sounding with sweet songs, armed with lances, winged with steeds.<br> Fly unto us with noblest food, like birds, O ye of mighty power.<br> 2 With their red-hued or, haply, tawny coursers which speed their chariots on, they come for glory.<br> Brilliant like gold is he who holds the thunder. Earth have they smitten with the chariot's felly.<br> 3 For beauty ye have swords upon your bodies. As they stir woods so may they stir our spirits.<br> For your sake, O ye Maruts very mighty and well-born, have they set the stone, in motion.<br> 4 The days went round you and came back O yearners, back, to this prayer and to this solemn worship.<br> The Gotamas making their prayer with singing have pushed the well's lid up to drink the water.<br> 5 No hymn way ever known like this aforetime which Gotama sang forth for you, O Maruts,<br> What time upon your golden wheels he saw you, wild boars rushing about with tusks of iron.<br> 6 To you this freshening draught of Soma rusheth, O Maruts, like the voice of one who prayeth.<br> It rusheth freely from our hands as these libations wont to flow.</p>
