<TD><P>Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned     
from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in           
Ziklag;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>It     
came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp    
from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when   
he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And David said unto him,    
From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I   
escaped.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he          
answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also 
are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And David said unto the     
young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be     
dead?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And the  
young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa,        
behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed 
hard after him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I          
answered, Here am I.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an           
Amalekite.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>He  
said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is    
come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>So I stood upon him, and slew     
him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I  
took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm,    
and have brought them hither unto my lord.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent   
them; and likewise all the men that were with him:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And they mourned, and wept, and   
fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of    
YHVH, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And David said  
unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the    
son of a stranger, an Amalekite.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14>   
<H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to     
stretch forth thine hand to destroy YHVH's anointed?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And David called one of the young 
men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And David said  
unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against      
thee, saying, I have slain YHVH's anointed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And David lamented with this lamentation over   
Saul and over Jonathan his son:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>
18</H4></TD><TD><P>(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of    
the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>The beauty of Israel is slain     
upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Tell it not in Gath, publish it   
not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,   
lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there 
be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for    
there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as      
though he had not been anointed with oil.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of    
the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned 
not empty.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death   
they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than   
lions.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye    
daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other     
delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>How are the mighty fallen in the  
midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>I am distressed for  
thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me 
was wonderful, passing the love of women.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of   
war perished!</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John
