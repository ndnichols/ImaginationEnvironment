<TD><P>Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration 
of those things which are most surely believed among us,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Even as they delivered them unto    
us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>It seemed good to 
me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to 
write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>That thou mightest know the         
certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>THERE was in the days of Herod, 
the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia:    
and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And they were both     
righteous before ELOHIYM, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of     
YHVH blameless.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were 
now well stricken in years.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>     
8</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's      
office before ELOHIYM in the order of his course,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>According to the custom of the      
priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of    
YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of           
incense.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
there appeared unto him an angel of YHVH standing on the right side of the      
altar of incense.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>But the angel   
said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife       
Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And thou shalt have  
joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>For he shall be great in the      
sight of YHVH, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be   
filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And many of the children of       
Israel shall he turn to YHVH their ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And he shall go before him in the spirit and    
power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the      
disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for      
YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man,  
and my wife well stricken in years.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19>
<H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel,     
that stand in the presence of ELOHIYM; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to   
shew thee these glad tidings.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>  
20</H4></TD><TD><P>And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak,      
until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not  
my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And the people waited for         
Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he came out, he  
could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the  
temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, that, as 
soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own  
house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months,     
saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus 
hath YHVH dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my    
reproach among men.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from ELOHIYM unto a    
city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27>   
<H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of  
the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And the angel came in unto her,   
and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, YHVH is with thee: blessed art   
thou among women.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her    
mind what manner of salutation this should be.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: 
for thou hast found favour with ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb,   
and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name YAHSHUA.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>He shall be great, and shall be   
called the Son of the ELYOWN: and the ADONAY YHVH shall give unto him the       
throne of his father David:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>    
33</H4></TD><TD><P>And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of  
his kingdom there shall be no end.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34> 
<H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing 
I know not a man?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon 
thee, and the power of ELYOWN shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy   
thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of ELOHIYM.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>And, behold, thy     
cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the 
sixth month with her, who was called barren.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>For with ELOHIYM nothing shall be               
impossible.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of YHVH; be it unto me according to thy      
word. And the angel departed from her.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>And Mary arose in those days, and went into the 
hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>And entered into the house of Zacharias, and 
saluted Elisabeth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary,  
the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>And she spake   
out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is   
the fruit of thy womb.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And whence is this to me, that the mother of my ADONAY should come  
to me?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>For,  
lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe       
leaped in my womb for joy.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45><H4>     
45</H4></TD><TD><P>And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a       
performance of those things which were told her from YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46><H4>46</H4></TD><TD><P>And Mary said, My soul doth       
magnify YHVH,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>47</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And my spirit hath rejoiced in ELOHIYM my Saviour.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V48><H4>48</H4></TD><TD><P>For he hath regarded the low      
estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall    
call me blessed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V49><H4>49</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his      
name.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V50><H4>50</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V51><H4>51</H4></TD><TD><P>He hath shewed strength   
with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their           
hearts.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V52><H4>52</H4></TD><TD><P>He   
hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V53><H4>53</H4></TD><TD><P>He hath filled  
the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V54><H4>54</H4></TD><TD><P>He hath holpen his        
servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

his seed for ever.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V56><H4>56</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own      
house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V57><H4>57</H4></TD><TD><P>Now   
Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth  
a son.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V58><H4>58</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
her neighbours and her cousins heard how YHVH had shewed great mercy upon her;  
and they rejoiced with her.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V59><H4>    
59</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to     
circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his      
father.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V60><H4>60</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V61><H4>61</H4></TD><TD><P>And they said unto her,   
There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V65><H4>65</H4></TD><TD><P>And fear came on all
