<p>1. HEARD be our prayer! In thought I honour Agni first: now straightway we elect this heavenly company, Indra and V&#257;yu we elect.<br> For when our latest thought is raised and on Vivasv&#257;n centred well,<br> Then may our holy songs go forward on their way, our songs as &#146;twere unto the Gods.<br> 2 As there ye, Mitra, Varu&#7751;a, above the true have taken to yourselves the untrue with your mind, with wisdom's mental energy,<br> So in the seats wherein ye dwell have we beheld the Golden One,<br> Not with our thoughts or spirit, but with these our eyes, yea, with the eyes that Soma gives.<br> 3 A&#347;vins, the pious call you with their hymns of praise, sounding their loud song forth to you, these living men, to their oblations, living men.<br> All glories and all nourishment, Lords of all wealth! depend on you.<br> The fellies of your golden chariot scatter drops, Mighty Ones! of your golden car.<br> 4 Well is it known, O Mighty Ones: ye open heaven; for you the chariot-steeds are yoked for morning rites, unswerving steeds for morning rites,<br> We set you on the chariot-seat, ye Mighty, on the golden car.<br> Ye seek mid-air as by a path that leads aright, as by a path that leads direct.<br> 5 O Rich in Strength, through your great power vouchsafe us blessings day and night.<br> The offerings which we bring to you shall never fail, gifts brought by us shall never fail.<br> 6 These Soma-drops, strong Indra! drink for heroes, poured, pressed out by pressing-stones, are welling forth for thee, for thee the drops are welling forth.<br> They shall make glad thy heart to give, to give wealth great and wonderful.<br> Thou who acceptest praise come glorified by hymns, come thou to us benevolent.<br> 7 Quickly, O Agni, hear us: magnified by us thou shalt speck for us to the Gods adorable yea, to the Kings adorable:<br> When, O ye Deities, ye gave that Milch-cow to the A&#7749;girases,<br> They milked her: Aryaman, joined with them, did the work: he knoweth her as well as I.<br> 8 Ne&#146;er may these manly deeds of yours for us grow old, never may your bright glories fall into decay, never before our time decay.<br> What deed of yours, new every age, wondrous, surpassing man, rings forth,<br> Whatever, Maruts! may be difficult to gain, grant us, whate&#146;er is hard to gain.<br> 9 Dadhyac of old, A&#7749;giras, Priyamedha these, and Ka&#7751;va, Atri, Manu knew my birth, yea, those of ancient days and Manu knew.<br> Their long line stretcheth to the Gods, our birth-connexions are with them.<br> To these, for their high station, I bow down with song, to Indra, Agni, bow with song.<br> 10 Let the Invoker bless: let offerers bring choice gifts; B&#7771;haspati the Friend doth sacrifice with Steers, Steers that have many an excellence.<br> Now with our ears we catch the sound of the press-stone that rings afar.<br> The very Strong hath gained the waters by himself, the strong gained many a resting-place.<br> 11 O ye Eleven Gods whose home is heaven, O ye Eleven who make earth your dwelling,<br> Ye who with might, Eleven, live in waters, accept this sacrifice, O Gods, with pleasure.</p>
