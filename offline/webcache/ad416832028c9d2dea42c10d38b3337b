<p>1. THE guerdon is bestowed: the Mighty takes his Seat, and, ever-Watchful, guards from fiend and evil sprite.<br> Gold-hued, he makes the cloud his diadem, the milk his carpet in both worlds, and prayer his robe of state.<br> 2 Strong, bellowing, he goes, like one who slays the folk; he lets this hue of Asuras flow off from him,<br> Throws off his covering, seeks his father's meeting-place, and thus makes for himself the bright robe he assumes.<br> 3 Onward he flows, from both the hands, pressed out with stones: excited by the prayer, the water makes him wild.<br> He frolics and draws near, completes his work with song, and bathes in streams to satisfy the worshipper.<br> 4 They pour out meath around the Master of the house, Celestial Strengthener of the mountain that gives might;<br> In whom, through his great powers, oblation-eating cows in their uplifted udder mix their choicest milk.<br> 5 They, the ten sisters, on the lap of Aditi, have sent him forward like a car from both the arms.<br> He wanders and comes near the Cow's mysterious place, even the place which his inventions have produced.<br> 6 Like as a falcon to his home, so speeds the God to his own golden wisely-tashioned place to rest.<br> With song they urge the darling to the sacred grass: the Holy One goes like a courser to the Gods.<br> 7 From far away, from heaven, the redhued noted Sage, Steer of the triple height, hath sung unto the kine.<br> With thousand guidings he, leading this way and that, shines, as a singer, splendidly through many a morn.<br> 8 His covering assumes a radiant hue; where&#146;er he comes into the fight he drives the foe afar.<br> The Winner of the Floods, with food he seeks the host of heaven, he comes to praises glorified with milk.<br> 9 Like a bull roaming round the herds he bellows: he hath assumed the brilliancy of S&#363;rya.<br> Down to the earth hath looked the heavenly Falcon: Soma with wisdom views all living creatures.</p>
