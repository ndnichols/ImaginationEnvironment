<p>1. SEND unto us a good and happy mind.<br> 2 1 worship Agni, Youthfullest of Gods, resistless, Friend of laws;<br> Under whose guard and heavenly light the Spotted seek the Mother's breast:<br> 3 Whom with their mouth they magnify, bannered with flame and homed in light.<br> He glitters with his row of teeth.<br> 4 Kind, Furtherer of men, he comes, when he hath reached the ends of heaven,<br> Sage, giving splendour to the clouds.<br> 5 To taste man's offerings, he, the Strong, hath risen erect at sacrifice:<br> Fixing his dwelling he proceeds.<br> 6 Here are oblation, worship, rest: rapidly comes his furtherance.<br> To sword-armed Agni come the Gods.<br> 7 With service for chief bliss I seek the Lord of Sacrifice, Agni, whom<br> They call the Living, Son of Cloud.<br> 8 Blest evermore be all the men who come from us, who magnify<br> Agni with sacrificial gifts.<br> 9 The path he treads is black and white and red, and striped, and brown, crimson, and glorious.<br> His sire begat him bright with hues of gold.<br> 10 Thus with his thoughts, O Son of Strength, O Agni, hath Vimada, accordant with the Immortals,<br> Offered thee hymns, soliciting thy favour. Thou hast brought all food, strength, a prosperous dwelling.</p>
