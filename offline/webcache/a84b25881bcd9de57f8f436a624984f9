1</H4></TD><TD><P>There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in   
MASHIYACH YAHSHUA, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>For the law of the     
Spirit of life in MASHIYACH YAHSHUA hath made me free from the law of sin and   
death.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>For     
what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, ELOHIYM       
sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin 
in the flesh:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P> 
That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after  
the flesh, but after the Spirit.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>
5</H4></TD><TD><P>For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the   
flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>For to be carnally     
minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Because the carnal mind is  
enmity against EL: for it is not subject to the law of ELOHIYM, neither indeed  
can be.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>So     
then they that are in the flesh cannot please ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>But ye are not in the flesh, but in 
the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of ELOHIYM dwell in you. Now if any man    
have not the Spirit of MASHIYACH, he is none of his.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And if MASHIYACH be in you, the   
body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of                  
righteousness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>But if the Spirit of him that raised up YAHSHUA from the dead dwell in you,  
he that raised up MASHIYACH from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies 
by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12>
<H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh,   
to live after the flesh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4>
</TD><TD><P>For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the 
Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>For as many as are led by the     
Spirit of EL, they are the sons of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>For ye have not received the spirit of bondage  
again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry,     
Abba, Father.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children  
of ELOHIYM:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And if children, then heirs; heirs of ELOHIYM, and joint-heirs with MASHIYACH;  
if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>For I reckon    
that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the 
glory which shall be revealed in us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>For the earnest expectation of the creature     
waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>For the creature was made subject 
to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in   
hope,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>       
Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of         
corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>For we know that the      
whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And not only they, but    
ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves     
groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our 
body.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>For we 
are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why 
doth he yet hope for?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait   
for it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>     
Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we       
should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us   
with groanings which cannot be uttered.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what   
is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints        
according to the will of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28>  
<H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And we know that all things work together for good to    
them that love ELOHIYM, to them who are the called according to his purpose.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>For whom he did 
foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son,     
that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover whom he did              
predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified:  
and whom he justified, them he also glorified.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>What shall we then say to these things? If   
ELOHIYM be for us, who can be against us?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>He that spared not his own Son, but delivered   
him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>Who shall lay   
any thing to the charge of ELOHIYM's elect? It is EL that justifieth.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>Who is he that       
condemneth? It is MASHIYACH that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is  
even at the right hand of ELOHIYM, who also maketh intercession for us.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>Who shall separate   
us from the love of MASHIYACH? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution,  
or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>As it is written, For thy sake we are killed    
all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>Nay, in all these things we   
are more than conquerors through him that loved us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>For I am persuaded, that neither  
death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things         
present, nor things to come,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>   
39</H4></TD><TD><P>Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able 
to separate us from the love of ELOHIYM, which is in MASHIYACH YAHSHUA our      
ADONAY.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M.
