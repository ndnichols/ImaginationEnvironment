<p>1. O THE Wind's chariot, O its power and glory! Crashing it goes and hath a voice of thunder.<br> It makes the regions red and touches heaven, and as it moves the dust of earth is scattered.<br> 2 Along the traces of the Wind they hurry, they come to him as dames to an assembly.<br> Borne on his car with these for his attendants, the God speeds forth, the universe's Monarch.<br> 3 Travelling on the paths of air's mid-region, no single day doth he take rest or slumber.<br> Holy and earliest-born, Friend of the waters, where did he spring and from what region came he?<br> 4 Germ of the world, the Deities&#146; vital spirit, this God moves ever as his will inclines him.<br> His voice is heard, his shape is ever viewless. Let us adore this Wind with our oblation.</p>
