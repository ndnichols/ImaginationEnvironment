<p>1. WITH powers of Mighty Ones hath he, Ancient, Beloved, been equipped,<br> Through whom the Father Manu made prayers efficacious with the Gods.<br> 2 Him, Maker of the sky, let stones wet with the Soma ne&#146;er forsake,<br> Nor hymns and prayer that must be said.<br> 3 Indra who knew full well disclosed the kine to the A&#7749;girases.<br> This his great deed must be extolled.<br> 4 Indra, promoter of the song, the sage's Strengthener as of old,<br> Shall come to bless and succour us at presentation of this laud.<br> 5 Now after their desire's intent the pious singers with the cry<br> Of Hail! have sung loud hymns to thee, Indra, to gain a stall of kine.<br> 6 With Indra rest all deeds of might, deeds done and yet to be performed,<br> Whom singers know devoid of guile.<br> 7 When the Five Tribes with all their men to Indra have sent out their voice,<br> And when the priest hath strewn much grass, this is the Friend's own dwelling-place.<br> 8 This praise is verily thine own: thou hast performed these manly deeds,<br> And sped the wheel upon its way.<br> 9 At the o&#146;erflowing of this Steer, boldly he strode for life, and took<br> Soma as cattle take their corn.<br> 10 Receiving this and craving help, we, who with you are Dak&#7779;a's sons,<br> Would fain exalt the Maruts&#146; Lord.<br> 11 Yea, Hero, with the singers we sing to the duly-coming Band.<br> Allied with thee may we prevail.<br> 12 With us are raining Rudras, clouds accordant in call to battle, at the death of V&#7771;tra,</p>  
<p>The strong assigned to him who sings and praises. May Gods with Indra at their head protect us.</p>
