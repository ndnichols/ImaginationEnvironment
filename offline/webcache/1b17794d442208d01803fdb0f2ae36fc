<p>1. GODDESS of wild and forest who seemest to vanish from the sight.<br> How is it that thou seekest not the village? Art thou not afraid?<br> 2 What time the grasshopper replies and swells the shrill cicala's voice,<br> Seeming to sound with tinkling bells, the Lady of the Wood exults.<br> 3 And, yonder, cattle seem to graze, what seems a dwelling-place appears:<br> Or else at eve the Lady of the Forest seems to free the wains.<br> 4 Here one is calling to his cow, another there hath felled a tree:<br> At eve the dweller in the wood fancies that somebody hath screamed.<br> 5 The Goddess never slays, unless some murderous enemy approach.<br> Man eats of savoury fruit and then takes, even as he wills, his rest.<br> 6 Now have I praised the Forest Queen, sweet-scented, redolent of balm,<br> The Mother of all sylvan things, who tills not but hath stores of food.</p>
