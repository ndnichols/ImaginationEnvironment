<TD><P>And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was noised   
that he was in the house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there    
was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached 
the word unto them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne  
of four.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof   
where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the 
sick of the palsy lay.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>When YAHSHUA saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy,   
Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4> 
6</H4></TD><TD><P>But there was certain of the scribes sitting there, and       
reasoning in their hearts,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but  
ELOHIYM only?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And immediately when YAHSHUA perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned      
within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your        
hearts?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>       
Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven      
thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>But that ye may know that the Son 
of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the        
palsy,)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>I    
say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And immediately 
he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they   
were all amazed, and glorified ELOHIYM, saying, We never saw it on this         
fashion.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him,   
and he taught them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the      
receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed      
him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And it  
came to pass, that, as YAHSHUA sat at meat in his house, many publicans and     
sinners sat also together with YAHSHUA and his disciples: for there were many,  
and they followed him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and   
sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh    
with publicans and sinners?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>    
17</H4></TD><TD><P>When YAHSHUA heard it, he saith unto them, They that are     
whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call 
the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees  
used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and  
of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA said unto them, Can   
the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as    
long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>But the days will come, when  
the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those 
days.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>No man 
also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that     
filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And no man putteth new    
wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine   
is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new   
bottles.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and   
his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And the Pharisees said unto   
him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto     
them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred,  
he, and they that were with him?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26>   
<H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>How he went into the house of ELOHIYM in the days of     
Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat 
but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them,    
The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore the Son of man is ADOWN 
also of the sabbath.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000
