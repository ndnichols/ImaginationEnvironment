1</H4></TD><TD><P>When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders   
of the people took counsel against YAHSHUA to put him to death:</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they had bound     
him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Judas, which 
had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and      
brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Saying, I have    
sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that  
to us? see thou to that.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed,  
and went and hanged himself.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>    
6</H4></TD><TD><P>And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is 
not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of        
blood.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And     
they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers   
in.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore  
that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Then was fulfilled that which was   
spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of        
silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel   
did value;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And gave them for the potter's field, as YHVH appointed me.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA stood before the  
governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews?    
And YAHSHUA said unto him, Thou sayest.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he was accused of the chief priests    
and elders, he answered nothing.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13>   
<H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many     
things they witness against thee?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14>  
<H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the   
governor marvelled greatly.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>    
15</H4></TD><TD><P>Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the  
people a prisoner, whom they would.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16>
<H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And they had then a notable prisoner, called             
Barabbas.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye 
that I release unto you? Barabbas, or YAHSHUA which is called MASHIYACH?</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>For he knew     
that for envy they had delivered him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>When he was set down on the judgment seat, his  
wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I   
have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>But the chief priests and     
elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy       
YAHSHUA.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>The 
governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I       
release unto you? They said, Barabbas.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then    
with YAHSHUA which is called MASHIYACH? They all say unto him, Let him be       
crucified.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the      
more, saying, Let him be crucified.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24>
<H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that  
rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the        
multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to    
it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Then     
answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>Then released   
he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged YAHSHUA, he delivered him to be 
crucified.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Then the soldiers of the governor took YAHSHUA into the common hall, and        
gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And they stripped him, and put on him a      
scarlet robe.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and  
a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him,   
saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>
30</H4></TD><TD><P>And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on  
the head.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put    
his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And as they came out, they found  
a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they were   
come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>They gave him        
vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would    
not drink.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be 
fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them,  
and upon my vesture did they cast lots.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>And sitting down they watched him there;</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And set up over 
his head his accusation written, THIS IS YAHSHUA THE KING OF THE JEWS.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>Then were there two  
thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>And they that   
passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple,    
and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of ELOHIYM,     
come down from the cross.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>      
41</H4></TD><TD><P>Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the        
scribes and elders, said,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>      
42</H4></TD><TD><P>He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King   
of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>He trusted in   
ELOHIYM; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the    
Son of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD>
<P>The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his        
teeth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P>Now   
from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth         
hour.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46><H4>46</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
about the ninth hour YAHSHUA cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama    
sabachthani? that is to say, My EL, my EL, why hast thou forsaken me?</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>47</H4></TD><TD><P>Some of them that    
stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V48><H4>48</H4></TD><TD><P>And straightway one  
of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a     
reed, and gave him to drink.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V49><H4>   
49</H4></TD><TD><P>The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to 
save him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V50><H4>50</H4></TD><TD><P>   
YAHSHUA, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V51><H4>51</H4></TD><TD><P>And, behold,    
the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the    
earth did quake, and the rocks rent;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V52><H4>52</H4></TD><TD><P>And the graves were opened; and many bodies of  
the saints which slept arose,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V53><H4>  
53</H4></TD><TD><P>And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went  
into the holy city, and appeared unto many.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V54><H4>54</H4></TD><TD><P>Now when the centurion, and they that were with 
him, watching YAHSHUA, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done,     
they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V55><H4>55</H4></TD><TD><P>And many women were there 
beholding afar off, which followed YAHSHUA from Galilee, ministering unto       
him:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V56><H4>56</H4></TD><TD><P>Among   
which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the       
mother of Zebedees children.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V57><H4>   
57</H4></TD><TD><P>When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, 
named Joseph, who also himself was YAHSHUA' disciple:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V58><H4>58</H4></TD><TD><P>He went to Pilate, and begged the 
body of YAHSHUA. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V59><H4>59</H4></TD><TD><P>And when Joseph had taken 
the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V60><H4>60</H4></TD><TD><P>And laid it in his own new tomb, which he    
had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the        
sepulchre, and departed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V61><H4>61</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over      
against the sepulchre.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V62><H4>62</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the     
chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V63><H4>63</H4></TD><TD><P>Saying, Sir, we remember that     
that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise        
again.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V64><H4>64</H4></TD><TD><P>      
Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his 
disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is     
risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V65><H4>65</H4></TD><TD><P>Pilate said unto     
them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V66><H4>66</H4></TD><TD><P>So they went, and made the    
sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
