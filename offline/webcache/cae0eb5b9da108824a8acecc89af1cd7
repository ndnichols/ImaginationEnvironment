were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the   
flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

My brethren, whence be ye? And they said, Of Haran are we.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

sheep.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And he  
said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be      
gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And they said, We cannot, until 
all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the

Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and 
embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban   
all these things.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD>

wages be?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>

her to another man: abide with me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20>

together all the men of the place, and made a feast.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass in the

that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this    
thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then    
hast thou beguiled me?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4>

<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And Jacob did so, and         
fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.</P></TD>

barren.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said,   
Surely YHVH hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love  
me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And she  
conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because YHVH hath heard I was hated,

conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be     
joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name      
called Levi.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>
And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise YHVH:
