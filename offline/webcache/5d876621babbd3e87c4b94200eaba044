<p>1. FORTH from the ocean sprang the wave of sweetness: together with the stalk it turned to Am&#7771;ta,<br> That which is holy oil's mysterious title: but the Gods&#146; tongue is truly Am&#7771;ta's centre.<br> 2 Let us declare aloud the name of Gh&#7771;ta, and at this sacrifice hold it up with homage.<br> So let the Brahman hear the praise we utter. This hath the four-horned Buffalo emitted.<br> 3 Four are his horns, three are the feet that bear him; his heads are two, his hands are seven in number.<br> Bound with a triple bond the Steer roars loudly: the mighty God hath entered in to mortals.<br> 4 That oil in triple shape the Gods discovered laid down within the Cow, concealed by Pa&#7751;is.<br> Indra produced one shape, S&#363;rya another: by their own power they formed the third from Vena.<br> 5 From inmost reservoir in countless channels flow down these rivers which the foe beholds not.<br> I look upon the streams of oil descending, and lo! the Golden Reed is there among them.<br> 6 Like rivers our libations flow together, cleansing themselves in inmost heart and spirit.<br> The streams of holy oil pour swiftly downward like the wild beasts that fly before the bowman.<br> 7 As rushing down the rapids of a river, flow swifter than the wind the vigorous currents,<br> The streams of oil in swelling fluctuation like a red courser bursting through the fences.<br> 8 Like women at a gathering fair to look on and gently smiling, they incline to Agni.<br> The streams of holy oil attain the fuel, and J&#257;tavedas joyfully receives them.<br> 9 As maidens dock themselves with gay adornment to join the bridal feast, I now behold them.<br> Where Soma flows and sacrifice is ready, thither the streams of holy oil are running.<br> 10 Send to our eulogy a herd of cattle bestow upon us excellent possessions.<br> Bear to the Gods the sacrifice we offer the streams of oil flow pure and full of sweetness.<br> 11 The universe depends upon thy power and might within the sea, within the heart, within all life.</p>
