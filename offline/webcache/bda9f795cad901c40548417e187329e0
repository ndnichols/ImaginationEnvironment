VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>For with what judgment ye judge, ye 
shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you     
again.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And why 
beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the   
beam that is in thine own eye?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>  
4</H4></TD><TD><P>Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote 
out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote 
out of thy brother's eye.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your     
pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again    
and rend you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be 
opened unto you:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him 
that knocketh it shall be opened.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9>   
<H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread,   
will he give him a stone?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>

evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your  
Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore all things      
whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this  
is the law and the prophets.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>   
13</H4></TD><TD><P>Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and

thereat:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and

<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Even so every good tree       
bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.</P>

prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name   
done many wonderful works?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>

24</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth 
them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:</P>

</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to  
pass, when YAHSHUA had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his   
doctrine:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>   
For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.</P></TD>
