unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them,

people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>For

</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Specially the   
day that thou stoodest before YHVH thy ELOHIYM in Horeb, when YHVH said unto

they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and

anger:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>I     
call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon
