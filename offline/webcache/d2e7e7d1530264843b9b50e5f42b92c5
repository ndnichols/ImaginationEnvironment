<p>1. SLIGHT us not Varu&#7751;a, Aryaman, or Mitra, &#7770;bhuk&#7779;an, Indra, &#256;yu, or the Maruts,<br> When we declare amid the congregation the virtues of the strong Steed, God-descended.<br> 2 What time they bear before the Courser, covered with trappings and with wealth, the grasped oblation,<br> The dappled goat goeth straightforward, bleating, to the place dear to Indra and to P&#363;&#7779;an.<br> 3 Dear to all Gods, this goat, the share of P&#363;&#7779;an, is first led forward with the vigorous Courser,<br> While Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar sends him forward with the Charger, acceptable for sacrifice, to glory.<br> 4 When thrice the men lead round the Steed, in order, who goeth to the Gods as meet oblation,<br> The goat precedeth him, the share of P&#363;&#7779;an, and to the Gods the sacrifice announceth.<br> 5 Invoker, ministering priest, atoner, fire-kindler Soma-presser, sage, reciter,<br> With this well ordered sacrifice, well finished, do ye fill full the channels of the rivers.<br> 6 The hewers of the post and those who carry it, and those who carve the knob to deck the Horse's stake;<br> Those who prepare the cooking-vessels for the Steed,&#151;may the approving help of these promote our work.<br> 7 Forth, for the regions of the Gods, the Charger with his smooth back is come my prayer attends him.<br> In him rejoice the singers and the sages. A good friend have we won for the Gods&#146; banquet.<br> 8 May the fleet Courser's halter and his heel-ropes, the head-stall and the girths and cords about him.<br> And the grass put within his mouth to bait him,&#151;among the Gods, too, let all these be with thee.<br> 9 What part of the Steed's flesh the fly hath eaten, or is left sticking to the post or hatchet,<br> Or to the slayer's hands and nails adhereth,&#151;among the Gods, too, may all this be with thee.<br> 10 Food undigested steaming from his belly, and any odour of raw flesh remaining,<br> This let the immolators set in order and dress the sacrifice with perfect cooking.<br> 11 What from thy body which with fire is roasted, when thou art set upon the spit, distilleth,<br> Let not that lie on earth or grass neglected, but to the longing Gods let all be offered.<br> 12 They who observing that the Horse is ready call out and say, the smell is good; remove it;<br> And, craving meat, await the distribution,&#151;may their approving help promote labour.<br> 13 The trial-fork of the flesh-cooking caldron, the vessels out of which the broth is sprinkled,<br> The warming-pots, the covers of the dishes, hooks, carving-boards,&#151;all these attend the Charger.<br> 14 The starting-place, his place of rest and rolling, the ropes wherewith the Charger's feet were fastened,<br> The water that he drank, the food he tasted,&#151;among the Gods, too, may all these attend thee.<br> 15 Let not the fire, smoke-scented, make thee crackle, nor glowing caldron smell and break to pieces.<br> Offered, beloved, approved, and consecrated,&#151;such Charger do the Gods accept with favour.<br> 16 The robe they spread upon the Horse to clothe him, the upper covering and the golden trappings,<br> The halters which restrain the Steed, the heel-ropes,&#151;all these, as grateful to the Gods, they offer.<br> 17 If one, when seated, with excessive urging hath with his heel or with his whip distressed thee,<br> All these thy woes, as with the oblations' ladle at sacrifices, with my prayer I banish.<br> 18 The four-and-thirty ribs of the. Swift Charger, kin to the Gods, the slayer's hatchet pierces.<br> Cut ye with skill, so that the parts be flawless, and piece by piece declaring them dissect them.<br> 19 Of Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar's Charger there is one dissector,&#151;this is the custom-two there are who guide him.<br> Such of his limbs as I divide in order, these, amid the balls, in fire I offer.<br> 20 Let not thy dear soul burn thee as thou comest, let not the hatchet linger in thy body.<br> Let not a greedy clumsy immolator, missing the joints, mangle thy limbs unduly.<br> 21 No, here thou diest not, thou art not injured: by easy paths unto the Gods thou goest.<br> Both Bays, both spotted mares are now thy fellows, and to the ass's pole is yoked the Charger.<br> 22 May this Steed bring us all-sustaining riches, wealth in good kine, good horses, manly offspring.<br> Freedom from sin may Aditi vouchsafe us: the Steed with our oblations gain us lordship!</p>
