<p>1. SCARCELY was &#346;atakratu, born when of his Mother he inquired,<br> Who are the mighty? Who are famed?<br> 2. Then &#346;avas&#299; declared to him Aur&#7751;av&#257;bha, Ah&#299;&#347;uva:<br> Son, these be they thou must o&#146;erthrow<br> 3 The V&#7771;tra-slayer smote them all as spokes are hammered into naves:<br> The Dasyu-killer waxed in might.<br> 4 Then Indra at a single draught drank the contents of thirty pails,<br> Pails that were filled with Soma juice.<br> 5 Indra in groundless realms of space pierced the Gandharva through, that he<br> Might make Brahmans' strength increase.<br> 6 Down from the mountains Indra shot hither his well-directed shaft:<br> He gained the ready brew of rice.<br> 7 One only is that shaft of thine, with thousand feathers, hundred barbs,<br> Which, Indra, thou hast made thy friend.<br> 8 Strong as the &#7770;bhus at thy birth, therewith to those who praise thee, men,<br> And women, bring thou food to eat.<br> 9 By thee these exploits were achieved, the mightiest deeds, abundantly:<br> Firm in thy heart thou settest them.<br> 10 All these things Vi&#7779;&#7751;u brought, the Lord of ample stride whom thou hadst sent-<br> A hundred buffaloes, a brew of rice and milk: and Indra, slew the ravening boar<br> 11 Most deadly is thy bow, successful, fashioned well: good is thine arrow, decked with gold.<br> Warlike and well equipped thine arms are, which increase sweetness for him who drinks the sweet.</p>
