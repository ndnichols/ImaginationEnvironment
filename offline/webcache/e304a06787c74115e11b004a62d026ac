1</H4></TD><TD><P>And the word of YHVH came unto me, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Son of man, prophesy against    
the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the ADONAY     
YHVH unto the shepherds; Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed         
themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you   
with the wool, ye kill them that are fed: but ye feed not the flock.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>The diseased have ye   
not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye   
bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was    
driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and     
with cruelty have ye ruled them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>
5</H4></TD><TD><P>And they were scattered, because there is no shepherd: and    
they became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>My sheep wandered 
through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my flock was          
scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek after     
them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>         
Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of YHVH;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>As I live, saith the ADONAY YHVH, surely       
because my flock became a prey, and my flock became meat to every beast of the  
field, because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my    
flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock;</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear 
the word of YHVH;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH; Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I    
will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the   
flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver 
my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>For thus saith the ADONAY     
YHVH; Behold, I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>As a shepherd        
seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered; 
so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they 
have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will bring them out from the people,   
and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and  
feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited  
places of the country.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of  
Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and in a fat   
pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>I will feed my flock, and I will  
cause them to lie down, saith the ADONAY YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>I will seek that which was lost, and bring   
again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and   
will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the strong; 
I will feed them with judgment.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>
17</H4></TD><TD><P>And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the ADONAY YHVH;      
Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he          
goats.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>      
Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, but ye     
must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to have drunk  
of the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet?</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And as for my flock, they 
eat that which ye have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which ye     
have fouled with your feet.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>    
20</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore thus saith the ADONAY YHVH unto them; Behold, I,   
even I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Because ye have      
thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed all the diseased with your       
horns, till ye have scattered them abroad;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall  
no more be a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will set up one         
shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall     
feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And I YHVH will be their ELOHIYM, and my        
servant David a prince among them; I YHVH have spoken it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will make with them a       
covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and 
they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will make them and  
the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come  
down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And the tree of the field shall   
yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe 
in their land, and shall know that I am YHVH, when I have broken the bands of   
their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves  
of them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the beast of the     
land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make them         
afraid.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no more consumed  
with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus shall they 
know that I YHVH their ELOHIYM am with them, and that they, even the house of   
Israel, are my people, saith the ADONAY YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture,    
are men, and I am your ELOHIYM, saith the ADONAY YHVH.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
