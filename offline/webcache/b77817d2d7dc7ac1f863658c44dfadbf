Egypt?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And

them, and that thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and

me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>         
Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I sware to make you 
dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>But your little

the land which ye have despised.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32>   
<H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>But as for you, your carcasses, they shall fall in this

And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your     
whoredoms, until your carcasses be wasted in the wilderness.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>After the number of the days  
in which ye searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye   
bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my breach of          
promise.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>I   
YHVH have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are

the land,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the     
plague before YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD>
<TD><P>But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of

<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>And they rose up early in the 
morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here,  
and will go up unto the place which YHVH hath promised: for we have sinned.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses said, 
Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of YHVH? but it shall not        
prosper.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>Go  
not up, for YHVH is not among you; that ye be not smitten before your           
enemies.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>For 
the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye shall fall by    
the sword: because ye are turned away from YHVH, therefore YHVH will not be     
with you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>   
But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the

them, even unto Hormah.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright
