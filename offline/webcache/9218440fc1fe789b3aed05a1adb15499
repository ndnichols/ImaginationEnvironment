<p>1. MAY benediction of the Gods approach us, holy, to aid us with all rapid succours.<br> Therewith may we be happily befriended, and pass triumphant over all our troubles.<br> 2 A man should think on wealth and strive to win it by adoration on the path of Order,<br> Counsel himself with his own mental insight, and grasp still nobler vigour with his spirit.<br> 3 The hymn is formed, poured are the allotted portions: as to a ford friends come unto the Wondrous.<br> We have obtained the power of case and comfort, we haVe become acquainted, with Immortals.<br> 4 Pleased be the Eternal Lord who loves the household with this man whom God Savitar created.<br> May Bhaga Aryaman grace him with cattle: may he appear to him, and be, delightful.<br> 5 Like the Dawns' dwelling-place be this assembly, where in their might men rich in food have gathered.<br> Striving to share the praises of this singer. To us come strengthening and effectual riches!<br> 6 This Bull's most gracious far-extended favour existed first of all in full abundance.<br> By his support they are maintained in common who in the Asura's mansion dwell together.<br> 7 What was the tree, what wood, in sooth, produced it, from which they fashioned forth the Earth and Heaven?<br> These Twain stand fast and wax not old for ever: these have sung praise to many a day and morning.<br> 8 Not only here is this: more is beyond us. He is the Bull, the Heaven's and Earth's supporter.<br> With power divine he makes his skin a filter, when the Bay Coursers bear him on as S&#363;rya.<br> 9 He passes o&#146;er the broad earth like a Stega: he penetrates the world as Wind the mist-cloud.<br> He, balmed with oil, near Varu&#7751;a and Mitra, like Agni in the wood, hath shot forth splendour.<br> 10 When suddenly called the cow that erst was barren, she, self-protected, ended all her troubles.<br> Earth, when the first son sprang from sire and mother, cast up the gami, that which men were seeking.<br> 11 To N&#7771;&#7779;ad's son they gave the name of Kainva, and he the brown-hued courser won the treasure.<br> For him dark-coloured streamed the shining udder: none made it swell for him. Thus Order willed it.</p>
