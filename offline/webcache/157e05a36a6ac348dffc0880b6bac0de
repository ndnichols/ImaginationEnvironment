<TD><P>And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them 
that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the        
kingdom of EL come with power.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>  
2</H4></TD><TD><P>And after six days YAHSHUA taketh with him Peter, and James,  
and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he 
was transfigured before them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>   
3</H4></TD><TD><P>And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so   
as no fuller on earth can white them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses:    
and they were talking with YAHSHUA.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5> 
<H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And Peter answered and said to YAHSHUA, Master, it is     
good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and    
one for Moses, and one for Elias.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6>   
<H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>For he wist not what to say; for they were sore           
afraid.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud,    
saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And suddenly, when they had looked round about,   
they saw no man any more, save YAHSHUA only with themselves.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And as they came down from the  
mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had     
seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And they kept that saying with    
themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should   
mean.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must first come?</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And he answered and  
told them, Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is   
written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at       
nought.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>But  
I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him          
whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he came to his           
disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning     
with them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and  
running to him saluted him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>    
16</H4></TD><TD><P>And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And one of the  
multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which     
hath a dumb spirit;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and       
gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that     
they should cast him out; and they could not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>He answereth him, and saith, O faithless     
generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring    
him unto me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>
And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare 
him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And he asked his father, How long 
is it ago since this came unto him? And he said, Of a child.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And ofttimes it hath cast him 
into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any    
thing, have compassion on us, and help us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA said unto him, If thou canst believe,   
all things are possible to him that believeth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And straightway the father of the child      
cried out, and said with tears, ADONAY, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>When YAHSHUA    
saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying   
unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter  
no more into him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was 
as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>But YAHSHUA took him by the hand, 
and lifted him up; and he arose.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28>   
<H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked 
him privately, Why could not we cast him out?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, This kind can come    
forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And they departed thence, and passed through    
Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>For he taught his disciples, and  
said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they     
shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>But they        
understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And he came to Capernaum: and     
being in the house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves 
by the way?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P> 
But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves,   
who should be the greatest.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>    
35</H4></TD><TD><P>And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, 
If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of    
all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>And he  
took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in    
his arms, he said unto them,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>   
37</H4></TD><TD><P>Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name,     
receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that    
sent me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name,   
and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he followeth not us.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>But YAHSHUA     
said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name,  
that can lightly speak evil of me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40> 
<H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>For he that is not against us is on our part.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>For whosoever shall  
give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to MASHIYACH,    
verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>And whosoever shall offend one of 
these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone     
were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>And if thy hand offend thee, cut  
it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands  
to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>Where their worm dieth not,   
and the fire is not quenched.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45><H4>  
45</H4></TD><TD><P>And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for    
thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into   
the fire that never shall be quenched:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

quenched.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>47</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into 
the kingdom of EL with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell       
fire:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V48><H4>48</H4></TD><TD><P>Where  
their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V49><H4>49</H4></TD><TD><P>For every one shall be salted     
with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves,   
and have peace one with another.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
