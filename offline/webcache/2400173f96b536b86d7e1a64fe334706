<TD><P>And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your      
voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And now, behold, the king   
walketh before you: and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with  
you: and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Behold, here I am: witness  
against me before YHVH, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or      
whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of  
whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will   
restore it you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast    
thou taken ought of any man's hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5> 
<H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, YHVH is witness against you, and   
his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found ought in my hand. And  
they answered, He is witness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>   
6</H4></TD><TD><P>And Samuel said unto the people, It is YHVH that advanced     
Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Now therefore     
stand still, that I may reason with you before YHVH of all the righteous acts   
of YHVH, which he did to you and to your fathers.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>When Jacob was come into Egypt, and 
your fathers cried unto YHVH, then YHVH sent Moses and Aaron, which brought     
forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they forgat   
YHVH their ELOHIYM, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host   
of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king   
of Moab, and they fought against them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And they cried unto YHVH, and said, We have     
sinned, because we have forsaken YHVH, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth:    
but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH sent   
Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the    
hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And when ye saw that Nahash the   
king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a     
king shall reign over us: when YHVH your ELOHIYM was your king.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Now therefore behold the  
king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have desired! and, behold, YHVH hath set  
a king over you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>If ye will fear YHVH, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel   
against the commandment of YHVH, then shall both ye and also the king that      
reigneth over you continue following YHVH your ELOHIYM:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>But if ye will not obey the voice 
of YHVH, but rebel against the commandment of YHVH, then shall the hand of YHVH 
be against you, as it was against your fathers.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Now therefore stand and see this great       
thing, which YHVH will do before your eyes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call     
unto YHVH, and he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see     
that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of YHVH, in      
asking you a king.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>So Samuel called unto YHVH; and YHVH sent thunder and rain that day: and 
all the people greatly feared YHVH and Samuel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray    
for thy servants unto YHVH thy ELOHIYM, that we die not: for we have added unto 
all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye   
have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following YHVH, but      
serve YHVH with all your heart;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>
21</H4></TD><TD><P>And turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after vain      
things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>For YHVH will not forsake his 
people for his great name's sake: because it hath pleased YHVH to make you his  
people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>     
Moreover as for me, forbid that I should sin against YHVH in ceasing to pray    
for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Only fear YHVH, and serve him in  
truth with all your heart: for consider how great things he hath done for       
you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>But if  
ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king.</P>
