1</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus saith YHVH, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my 
footstool: where is the house that ye build unto me? and where is the place of  
my rest?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>For   
all those things hath mine hand made, and all those things have been, saith     
YHVH: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite   
spirit, and trembleth at my word.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3>   
<H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that     
sacrificeth a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that offereth an          
oblation, as if he offered swine's blood; he that burneth incense, as if he     
blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul           
delighteth in their abominations.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4>   
<H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their  
fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did 
not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose that in which I         
delighted not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>
Hear the word of YHVH, ye that tremble at his word; Your brethren that hated    
you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said, Let YHVH be glorified: but he  
shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>A voice of noise from the city, a   
voice from the temple, a voice of YHVH that rendereth recompence to his         
enemies.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>      
Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was          
delivered of a man child.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the   
earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once? for 
as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Shall I bring to the birth, and not 
cause to bring forth? saith YHVH: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the    
womb? saith thy ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love   
her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>That ye may suck, and be          
satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may milk out, and be    
delighted with the abundance of her glory.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>For thus saith YHVH, Behold, I will extend      
peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: 
then shall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon her sides, and be dandled upon her   
knees.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>As    
one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be          
comforted in Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones      
shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of YHVH shall be known toward his     
servants, and his indignation toward his enemies.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>For, behold, YHVH will come with  
fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury,    
and his rebuke with flames of fire.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16>
<H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>For by fire and by his sword will YHVH plead with all    
flesh: and the slain of YHVH shall be many.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine's flesh,   
and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith YHVH.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>For I know      
their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations   
and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will set a sign among them, 
and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul,   
and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles afar off, that    
have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my   
glory among the Gentiles.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>      
20</H4></TD><TD><P>And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto  
YHVH out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon  
mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith YHVH, as the 
children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of        
YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And I  
will also take of them for priests and for Levites, saith YHVH.</P></TD></TR>

worship before me, saith YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>

men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither    
shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.</P>
