<p>1. THE God hath looked, even Agni J&#257;tavedas, to meet the Dawns refulgent in their glories.<br> Come on your chariot, ye who travel widely, come to this sacrifice of ours, N&#257;satyas.<br> 2 Producing light for all the world of creatures, God Savitar hath raised aloft his banner.<br> Making his presence known by sunbeams, S&#363;rya hath filled the firmament and earth and heaven.<br> 3 Red Dawn is come, riding with brightness onward, distinguished by her beams, gay-hued and mighty.<br> Dawn on her nobly-harnessed car, the Goddess, awaking men to happiness, approacheth.<br> 4 May those most powerful steeds and chariot bring you, O A&#347;vins, hither at the break of morning.<br> Here for your draught of meath are Soma juices: at this our sacrifice rejoice, ye Mighty.<br> 5 How is it that, unbound and unsupported, he falleth not although directed downward?<br> By what self-power moves he? Who hath seen it? He guards the vault of heaven, a close-set pillar?</p>
