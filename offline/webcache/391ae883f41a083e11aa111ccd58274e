the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, 
and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem,   
out of their graves:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the     
host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom 
they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshipped:     
they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face 
of the earth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that      
remain of this evil family, which remain in all the places whither I have       
driven them, saith YHVH of hosts.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4>   
<H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith YHVH; Shall 
they fall, and not arise? shall he turn away, and not return?</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Why then is this people of      
Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they  
refuse to return.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD>
<P>I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright: no man repented him of his 
wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turned to his course, as the    
horse rusheth into the battle.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>  
7</H4></TD><TD><P>Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and 
the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but  
my people know not the judgment of YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

is with us? Lo, certainly in vain made he it; the pen of the scribes is in      
vain.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>The wise 
men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word   
of YHVH; and what wisdom is in them?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

and their fields to them that shall inherit them: for every one from the least  
even unto the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even unto the 
priest every one dealeth falsely.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11>  
<H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my      
people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Were they ashamed when they   
had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could     
they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of      
their visitation they shall be cast down, saith YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

YHVH: there shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the   
leaf shall fade; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from     
them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Why do 
we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defenced cities,
