Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into      
hell.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And if

her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced          
committeth adultery.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4>

Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto YHVH thine oaths:</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>But I say unto

for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great  
King.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>       
Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair      
white or black.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD>
<P>But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more    
than these cometh of evil.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>
