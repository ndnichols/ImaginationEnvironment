<p>1. MAY Dyaus the Lord of lauded wealth, and Earth stand by the man who offers sacrifice,<br> And may the A&#347;vins, both the Gods, strengthen the worshipper with bliss.<br> 2 As such we honour you, Mitra and Varu&#7751;a, with hasty zeal, most blest, you who sustain the folk.<br> So may we, through your friendship for the worshipper, subdue the fiends.<br> 3 And when we seek to win your love and friendship, we&#7817;ho have precious wealth in our possession,<br> Or when the worshipper augments his riches let not his treasures be shut up<br> 4 That other, Asura! too was born of Heaven. thou art, O Varu&#7751;a, the King of all men.<br> The chariot's Lord was well content, forbearing to anger Death by sin so great.<br> This sin hath Sakaputa here committed. Heroes who fled to their dear friend he slayeth,<br> When the Steed bringeth down your grace and favour in bodies dear and worshipful.<br> 6 Your Mother Aditi, ye wise, was purified with water even as earth is purified from heaven.<br> Show love and kindness here below: wash her in rays of heavenly light.<br> 7 Ye Twain have seated you as Lords of Wealth, as one who mounts a car to him who sits upon the pole, upon the wood.<br> These our disheartened tribes Nrmedhas saved from woe, Sumedhas saved from Woe.</p>
