1</H4></TD><TD><P>I say the truth in MASHIYACH, I lie not, my conscience also   
bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow  
in my heart.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>  
For I could wish that myself were accursed from MASHIYACH for my brethren, my   
kinsmen according to the flesh:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4> 
4</H4></TD><TD><P>Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the  
glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service, and the   
promises;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>     
Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh MASHIYACH came, who  
is over all, ELOHIYM blessed for ever. Amen.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Not as though the word of ELOHIYM hath taken none 
effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Neither, because they are the seed  
of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>That is, They     
which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of ELOHIYM: but 
the children of the promise are counted for the seed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>For this is the word of promise, At 
this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And not only this; but when       
Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac;</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>(For the children being not   
yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of ELOHIYM     
according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>It was said     
unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau  
have I hated.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with YHVH? Forbid.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>For he saith to      
Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion  
on whom I will have compassion.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>
16</H4></TD><TD><P>So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that       
runneth, but of YHVH that sheweth mercy.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for  
this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee,    
and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore hath he mercy on    
whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou wilt say then unto me, Why   
doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Nay but, O man, who art thou that 
repliest against YHVH? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why    
hast thou made me thus?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make   
one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>What if ELOHIYM, willing to shew  
his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the     
vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And that he might make known the riches of his  
glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Even us, whom he     
hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>As he saith also in Osee, I   
will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was  
not beloved.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>
And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye    
are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living EL.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>Esaias also     
crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the 
sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>For he will finish the work, and cut it short   
in righteousness: because a short work will the ADONAY YHVH make upon the       
earth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
as Esaias said before, Except YHVH of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been   
as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>What shall we say then? That the Gentiles,      
which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even    
the righteousness which is of faith.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>But Israel, which followed after the law of     
righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore? Because they       
sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they        
stumbled at that stumblingstone;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33>   
<H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone 
and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.</P>
