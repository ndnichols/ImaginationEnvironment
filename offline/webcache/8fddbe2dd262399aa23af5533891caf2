<p>1. HITHER, that I may live, I call unto the feast your wondrous car, thought-swift, borne on by rapid steeds.<br> With thousand banners, hundred treasures, pouring gifts, promptly obedient, bestowing ample room.<br> 2 Even as it moveth near my hymn is lifted up, and all the regions come together to sing praise.<br> I sweeten the oblations; now the helpers come. &#362;rj&#257;n&#299; hath, O A&#347;vins, mounted on your car.<br> 3 When striving man with man for glory they have met, brisk, measureless, eager for victory in fight,<br> Then verily your car is seen upon the slope when ye, O A&#347;vins, bring some choice boon to the prince.<br> 4 Ye came to Bhujyu while he struggled in the flood, with flying birds, self-yoked, ye bore him to his sires.<br> Ye went to the far-distant home, O Mighty Ones; and famed is your great aid to Divod&#257;sa given.<br> 5 A&#347;vins, the car which you had yoked for glorious show your own two voices urged directed to its goal.<br> Then she who came for friendship, Maid of noble birth, elected you as Husbands, you to be her Lords.<br> 6 Rebha ye saved from tyranny; for Atri's sake ye quenched with cold the fiery pit that compassed him.<br> Ye made the cow of &#346;ayu stream refreshing milk, and Vandana was holpen to extended life.<br> 7 Doers of marvels, skilful workers, ye restored Vandana, like a car, worn out with length of days.<br> From earth ye brought the sage to life in wondrous mode; be your great deeds done here for him who honours you.<br> 8 Ye went to him who mourned in a far distant place, him who was left forlorn by treachery of his sire.<br> Rich with the light of heaven was then the help ye gave, and marvellous your succour when ye stood by him.<br> 9 To you in praise of sweetness sang the honey-bee: Au&#347;ija calleth you in Soma's rapturous joy.<br> Ye drew unto yourselves the spirit of Dadhyac, and then the horse's head uttered his words to you.<br> 10 A horse did ye provide for Pedu, excellent, white, O ye A&#347;vins, conqueror of combatants,<br> Invincible in war by arrows, seeking heaven worthy of fame, like Indra, vanquisher of men.</p>
