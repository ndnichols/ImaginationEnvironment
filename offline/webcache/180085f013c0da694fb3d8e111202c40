<TD><P>Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the         
Passover.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared   
the people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the     
twelve.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And he 
went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might    
betray him unto them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And he promised, and sought     
opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Then came the day of   
unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And he sent Peter and John, saying, 
Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And they said unto him, Where wilt  
thou that we prepare?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city,   
there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the     
house where he entereth in.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>    
11</H4></TD><TD><P>And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master   
saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with 
my disciples?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And they went,  
and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the hour    
was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, With       
desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>For I say unto you,  
I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of EL.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And he took the 
cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>For I say unto  
you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of EL shall   
come.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And he 
took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is  
my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Likewise also the cup after   
supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for    
you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>But,    
behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And truly the Son of man  
goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And they began  
to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And there was   
also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said     
unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that 
exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>But ye shall not be so: but he    
that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as 
he that doth serve.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD>
<TD><P>For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is  
not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye are they which    
have continued with me in my temptations.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father  
hath appointed unto me;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on     
thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And the ADONAY said, Simon, Simon, behold,      
Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>But I have prayed for thee,   
that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy            
brethren.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And he said unto him, ADONAY, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and 
to death.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that  
thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, When I sent you without  
purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said he    
unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his     
scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>For I say unto  
you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was       
reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>And they said,  
ADONAY, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>And he came     
out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also   
followed him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into 
temptation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and      
prayed,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>     
Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not   
my will, but thine, be done.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>   
43</H4></TD><TD><P>And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven,            
strengthening him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it  
were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he rose up from prayer,  
and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46><H4>46</H4></TD><TD><P>And said unto them, Why   
sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>47</H4></TD><TD><P>And while he yet spake, behold a  
multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them,   
and drew near unto YAHSHUA to kiss him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V48><H4>48</H4></TD><TD><P>But YAHSHUA said unto him, Judas, betrayest     
thou the Son of man with a kiss?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V49>   
<H4>49</H4></TD><TD><P>When they which were about him saw what would follow,    
they said unto him, ADONAY, shall we smite with the sword?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V50><H4>50</H4></TD><TD><P>And one of them smote the servant 
of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V51><H4>51</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA answered and said, Suffer ye     
thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V52><H4>52</H4></TD><TD><P>Then YAHSHUA said unto the chief  
priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be 
ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V53><H4>53</H4></TD><TD><P>When I was daily with you in the  
temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the  
power of darkness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V54><H4>54</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's  
house. And Peter followed afar off.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V55>
<H4>55</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the     
hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V56><H4>56</H4></TD><TD><P>But a certain maid beheld him 
as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was    
also with him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V57><H4>57</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V58><H4>58</H4></TD><TD><P>And after a little while another  
saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V59><H4>59</H4></TD><TD><P>And about the   
space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this   
fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V60><H4>60</H4></TD><TD><P>And Peter said, Man, I know not   
what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V61><H4>61</H4></TD><TD><P>And the ADONAY       
turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the ADONAY, how 
he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V62><H4>62</H4></TD><TD><P>And Peter went out,  
and wept bitterly.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V63><H4>63</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And the men that held YAHSHUA mocked him, and smote him.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V64><H4>64</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they had         
blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy,  
who is it that smote thee?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V65><H4>     
65</H4></TD><TD><P>And many other things blasphemously spake they against       
him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V66><H4>66</H4></TD><TD><P>And as  
soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the      
scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V67><H4>67</H4></TD><TD><P>Art thou the MASHIYACH? tell  
us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V68><H4>68</H4></TD><TD><P>And if I also ask you, ye     
will not answer me, nor let me go.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V69> 
<H4>69</H4></TD><TD><P>Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of  
the power of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V70><H4>70</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of ELOHIYM? And he said   
unto them, Ye say that I am.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V71><H4>   
71</H4></TD><TD><P>And they said, What need we any further witness? for we      
ourselves have heard of his own mouth.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software
