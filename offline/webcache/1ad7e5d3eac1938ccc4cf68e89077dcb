1</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest;  
eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>So I opened my mouth, and he caused 
me to eat that roll.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy    
bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my     
mouth as honey for sweetness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>   
4</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house  
of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>For thou art not sent to a people of a strange 
speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel;</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Not to many people of a strange 
speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely,  
had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>But the house of Israel will    
not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of  
Israel are impudent and hardhearted.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8>
<H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces,  
and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>As an adamant harder than flint     
have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks,    
though they be a rebellious house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10> 
<H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that  
I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And go, get     
thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto  
them, and tell them, Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH; whether they will hear, or     
whether they will forbear.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>     
12</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of 
a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of YHVH from his place.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>I heard also the     
noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the    
noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>So the spirit lifted 
me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit;    
but the hand of YHVH was strong upon me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Then I came to them of the captivity at         
Telabib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and       
remained there astonished among them seven days.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass at the end of 
seven days, that the word of YHVH came unto me, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Son of man, I have made thee a    
watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and     
give them warning from me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>     
18</H4></TD><TD><P>When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou  
givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to 
save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood     
will I require at thine hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>  
19</H4></TD><TD><P>Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his        
wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou     
hast delivered thy soul.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and   
commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, he shall die: because  
thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness 
which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at     
thine hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he 
doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast        
delivered thy soul.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And the hand of YHVH was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go   
forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Then I arose, and went forth into 
the plain: and, behold, the glory of YHVH stood there, as the glory which I saw 
by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the spirit entered into me, and set me  
upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within      
thine house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>
But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind  
thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will make thy tongue cleave 
to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a   
reprover: for they are a rebellious house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>But when I speak with thee, I will open thy     
mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH; He that        
heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a  
rebellious house.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by
