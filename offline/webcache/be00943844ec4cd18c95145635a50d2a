<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>The word that came to Jeremiah  
from YHVH saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD>
<P>Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of Judah, and to  
the inhabitants of Jerusalem;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>   
3</H4></TD><TD><P>And say thou unto them, Thus saith YHVH ELOHIYM of Israel;    
Cursed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant,</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Which I commanded your fathers  
in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron    
furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command   
you: so shall ye be my people, and I will be your ELOHIYM:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>That I may perform the oath which I 
have sworn unto your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey,  
as it is this day. Then answered I, and said, So be it, O YHVH.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Then YHVH said unto me,     
Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of          
Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>For I earnestly        
protested unto your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land   
of Egypt, even unto this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my      
voice.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Yet     
they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the            
imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will bring upon them all the words 
of this covenant, which I commanded them to do: but they did them not.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH said unto me, 
A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of      
Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>  
They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to   
hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of       
Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their   
fathers.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Therefore thus saith YHVH, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they      
shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not      
hearken unto them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry  
unto the gods unto whom they offer incense: but they shall not save them at all 
in the time of their trouble.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>  
13</H4></TD><TD><P>For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O   
Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up   
altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense unto Baal.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore pray not   
thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them: for I will not  
hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>What hath my beloved to do in 
mine house, seeing she hath wrought lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is   
passed from thee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>YHVH called thy name, A green 
olive tree, fair, and of goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath 
kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>For YHVH of hosts, that planted   
thee, hath pronounced evil against thee, for the evil of the house of Israel    
and of the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke   
me to anger in offering incense unto Baal.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH hath given me knowledge of it, and I   
know it: then thou shewedst me their doings.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>But I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought  
to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me,      
saying, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off  
from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>But, O YHVH of       
hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the reins and the heart, let me    
see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I revealed my cause.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore thus saith YHVH 
of the men of Anathoth, that seek thy life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of 
YHVH, that thou die not by our hand:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore thus saith YHVH of hosts, Behold, I   
will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their    
daughters shall die by famine:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4> 
23</H4></TD><TD><P>And there shall be no remnant of them: for I will bring evil 
upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.</P></TD></TR>
