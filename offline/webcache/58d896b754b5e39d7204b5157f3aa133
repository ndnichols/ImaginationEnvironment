<p>1. O HEROES lordliest of all, who are ye that have singly come<br> Forth from a region most remote?<br> 2. Where are your horses, where the reins? How came ye? how had ye the power?<br> Rein was on nose and seat on back.<br> 3 The whip is laid upon the flank. The heroes stretch their thighs apart,<br> Like women when the babe is born.<br> 4 Go ye, O Heroes, far away, ye bridegrooms with a lovely Spouse<br> That ye may warm you at the fire.<br> 5 May she gain cattle for her meed, hundreds of sheep and steeds and kine,<br> Who threw embracing arms around the hero whom gyavaiva praised.<br> 6 Yea, many a woman is more firm and better than the man who turns<br> Away from Gods, andoffers not.<br> 7 She who discerns the weak and worn, the man who thirsts and is in want<br> She sets her mind upon the Gods.<br> 8 And yet full many a one, unpraised, mean niggard, is entitled man:<br> Only in weregild is he such.<br> 9 And she, the young, the joyous-spirited, divulged the path to &#346;y&#257;va, yea, to me.<br> Two red steeds carried me to Purum&#299;lha's side, that sage of far-extended fame,<br> 10 Him who, like Vaidadasvi, like Taranta, hath bestowed on me<br> A hundred cows in liberal gift.<br> 11 They who are borne by rapid steeds, drinking the meath that gives delight,<br> They have attained high glories here.<br> 12 They by whose splendour both the worlds are over-spread they shine on cars<br> As the gold gleams above in heaven.<br> 13 That Marut band is ever young, borne on bright cars, unblamable,<br> Moving to victory, checked by none.<br> 14 Who knoweth, verily, of these where the All-shakers take delight,<br> Born, spotless, after sacred Law?<br> 15 Guides are ye, lovers of the song to mortal man through holy hymn,<br> And hearers when he cries for help.<br> 16 Do ye, destroyers of the foe, worshipful and exceeding bright,<br> Send down the treasures that we crave.<br> 17 OUrmya, bear thou far away to Darbhya this my hymn of praise,<br> Songs, Goddess, as if chariot-borne.<br> 18 From me to Rathaviti say, when he hath pressed the Soma juice,<br> The wish I had departeth not.<br> 19 This wealthy Rathaviti dwells among the people rich in kine,<br> Among the mountains, far withdrawn.</p>
