<p>1 IMMORTAL J&#257;tavedas, thou many-hued fulgent gift of Dawn,<br> Agni, this day to him who pays oblations bring the Gods who waken with the morn.<br> 2 For thou art offering-bearer and loved messenger, the charioteer of sacrifice:<br> Accordant with the A&#347;vins and with Dawn grant us heroic strength and lofty fame.<br> 3 As messenger we choose to-day Agni the good whom many love,<br> Smoke-bannered spreader of the light, at break of day glory of sacrificial rites.<br> 4 Him noblest and most youthful, richly worshipped guest, dear to the men who offer gifts,<br> Him, Agni J&#257;tavedas, I beseech at dawn that he may bring the Gods to us.<br> 5 Thee, Agni, will I glorify, deathless nourisher of the world,<br> Immortal, offering-bearer, meet for sacred food, preserver, best at sacrifice.<br> 6 Tell good things to thy praiser, O most youthful God, as richly worshipped, honey-tongued,<br> And, granting to Praska&#7751;va lengthened days of life, show honour to the Heavenly Host.<br> 7 For the men, Agni, kindle thee as all possessor and as Priest;<br> So Agni, much-invoked, bring hither with all speed the Gods, the excellently wise,<br> 8 At dawn of day, at night, U&#7779;as and Savitar, the A&#347;vins, Bhaga, Agni's self:<br> Skilled in fair rites, with Soma poured, the Ka&#7751;vas light thee, the oblation-wafting God.<br> 9 For, Agni, Lord of sacrifice and messenger of men art thou:<br> Bring thou the Gods who wake at dawn who see the light, this day to drink the Soma juice.<br> 10 Thou shonest forth, O Agni, after former dawns, all visible, O rich in light.<br> Thou art our help in battle-strife, the Friend of man, the great high priest in sacrifice.<br> 11 Like Manu, we will stablish thee, Agni, performer of the rite,<br> Invoker, ministering Priest, exceeding wise, the swift immortal messenger.<br> 12 When as the Gods&#146; High Priest, by many loved, thou dost their mission as their nearest Friend,<br> Then, like the far-resounding billows of the flood, thy flames, O Agni, roar aloud.<br> 13 Hear, Agni, who hast ears to hear, with all thy train of escort Gods;<br> Let Mitra, Aryaman, seeking betimes our rite, seat them upon the sacred grass.<br> 14 Let those who strengthen Law, who bountifully give, the life-tongued Maruts, hear our praise.<br> May Law-supporting Varu&#7751;a with the A&#347;vins twain and U&#7779;as, drink the Soma juice.</p>
