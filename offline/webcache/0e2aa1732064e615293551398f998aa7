<p>1. MAY powers auspicious come to us from every side, never deceived, unhindered, and victorious,<br> That the Gods ever may be with us for our gain, our guardians day by day unceasing in their care.<br> 2 May the auspicious favour of the Gods be ours, on us descend the bounty of the righteous Gods.<br> The friendship of the Gods have we devoutly sought: so may the Gods extend our life that we may live.<br> 3 We call them hither with a hymn of olden time, Bhaga, the friendly Dak&#7779;a, Mitra, Aditi,<br> Aryaman, Varu&#7751;a, Soma, the A&#347;vins. May Sarasvat&#299;, auspicious, grant felicity.<br> 4 May the Wind waft to us that pleasant medicine, may Earth our Mother give it, and our Father Heaven,<br> And the joy-giving stones that press the Soma's juice. A&#347;vins, may ye, for whom our spirits long, hear this.<br> 5 Him we invoke for aid who reigns supreme, the Lord of all that stands or moves, inspirer of the soul,<br> That P&#363;&#7779;an may promote the increase of our wealth, our keeper and our guard infallible for our good.<br> 6 Illustrious far and wide, may Indra prosper us: may P&#363;&#7779;an prosper us, the Master of all wealth.<br> May T&#257;rk&#7779;ya with uninjured fellies prosper us: B&#7771;haspati vouchsafe to us prosperity.<br> 7 The Maruts, Sons of P&#7771;&#347;ni, borne by spotted steeds, moving in glory, oft visiting holy rites,<br> Sages whose tongue is Agni, brilliant as the Sun,&#151;hither let all the Gods for our protection come.<br> 8 Gods, may we with our ears listen to what is good, and with our eyes see what is good, ye Holy Ones.<br> With limbs and bodies firm may we extolling you attain the term of life appointed by the Gods.<br> 9 A hundred autumns stand before us, O ye Gods, within whose space ye bring our bodies to decay;<br> Within whose space our sons become fathers in turn. Break ye not in the midst our course of fleeting life.<br> 10 Aditi is the heaven, Aditi is mid-air, Aditi is the Mother and the Sire and Son.<br> Aditi is all Gods, Aditi five-classed men, Aditi all that hath been born and shall be born.</p>
