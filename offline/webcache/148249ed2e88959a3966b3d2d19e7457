And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul  
and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus'     
band.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And      
entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts 
of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And the next day we    
touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty   
to go unto his friends to refresh himself.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And when we had launched from thence, we sailed   
under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia 
and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And there the centurion found a     
ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And when we had sailed slowly   
many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, 
we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which   
is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Now when much time was      
spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already     
past, Paul admonished them,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>    
10</H4></TD><TD><P>And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will   
be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our  
lives.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>      
Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more  
than those things which were spoken by Paul.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And because the haven was not commodious to     
winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they    
might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and   
lieth toward the south west and north west.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the south wind blew softly, supposing  
that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by      
Crete.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>But   
not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the    
ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And running under a  
certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Which when they 
had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they    
should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And we being exceedingly  
tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And the third day we cast out 
with our own hands the tackling of the ship.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And when neither sun nor stars in many days     
appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was  
then taken away.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and     
said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete,   
and to have gained this harm and loss.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for   
there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>For there stood by   
me this night the angel of ELOHIYM, whose I am, and whom I serve,</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Saying, Fear not, Paul;   
thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, ELOHIYM hath given thee all them   
that sail with thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe ELOHIYM, that it   
shall be even as it was told me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26>   
<H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>But when the         
fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about        
midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And sounded, and found it 
twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again,    
and found it fifteen fathoms.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>  
29</H4></TD><TD><P>Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they     
cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And as the shipmen were about 
to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under    
colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>Paul said to the          
centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be     
saved.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>Then  
the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And while the day was     
coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the         
fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken         
nothing.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there  
shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he had thus spoken, he   
took bread, and gave thanks to ELOHIYM in presence of them all: and when he had 
broken it, he began to eat.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>    
36</H4></TD><TD><P>Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some    
meat.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And we 
were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they had eaten   
enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>And when it was day, 
they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into  
the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they had    
taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the    
rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>And falling     
into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart    
stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the    
violence of the waves.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of    
them should swim out, and escape.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43>  
<H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from  
their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves  
first into the sea, and get to land:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>And the rest, some on boards, and some on       
broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe   
to land.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M.
