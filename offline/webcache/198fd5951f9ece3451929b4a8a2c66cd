<p>1. THE streams unceasing flow to Indra, slayer of Ahi, Savitar, God, Law's fulfiller,<br> Day after day goes on the sheen of waters. What time hath past since they were first set flowing?<br> 2 His Mother&#151;for she knew&#151;spake and proclaimed him who was about to cast his bolt at V&#7771;tra.<br> Cutting their paths according to his pleasure day after day flow to their goal the rivers.<br> 3 Aloft he stood above the airy region, and against V&#7771;tra shot his deadly missile.<br> Enveloped in a cloud he rushed upon him. Indra subdued the foe with sharpened weapons.<br> 4 As with a bolt, B&#7771;haspati, fiercely flaming, pierce thou V&#7771;kadvaras&#146;, the Asura's, heroes.<br> Even as in time of old with might thou slewest, so slay even now our enemy, O Indra.<br> 5 Cast down from heaven on high thy bolt of thunder wherewith in joy thou smitest dead the foeman.<br> For gain of children make us thine, O Indra, of many children's children and of cattle.<br> 6 Whomso ye love, his power ye aid and strengthen; ye Twain are the rich worshipper's advancers.<br> Graciously favour us, Indra and Soma; give us firm standing in this time of danger.<br> 7 Let it not vex me, tire me, make me slothful, and never let us say, Press not the Soma;<br> For him who cares for me, gives gifts, supports me, who comes with kine to me who pour libations.<br> 8 Sarasvat&#299;, protect us: with the Maruts allied thou boldly conquerest our foemen,<br> While Indra does to death the daring chieftain of &#346;a&#7751;&#7693;ikas exulting in his prowess.<br> 9 Him who waylays, yea, him who would destroy us,&#151;aim at him, pierce him with thy sharpened weapon.<br> B&#7771;haspati, with arms thou slayest foemen O King, give up the spoiler to destruction.<br> 10 Perform, O Hero, with our valiant heroes the deeds heroic which thou hast to finish.<br> Long have they been inflated with presumption: slay them, and bring us hither their possessions.<br> 11 I craving joy address with hymn and homage your heavenly host, the company of Maruts,<br> That we may gain wealth with full store of heroes, each day more famous, and with troops of children.</p>
