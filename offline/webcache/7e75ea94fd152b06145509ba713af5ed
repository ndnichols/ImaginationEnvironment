<p>1. WHAT worthy praise will bring before us Indra, the Son of Strength, that he may grant us riches;<br> For he the Hero, gives the singer treasures: he is the Lord who sends us gifts, ye people.<br> 2 To be invoked and hymned in fight with V&#7771;tra, that well-praised Indra gives us real bounties.<br> That Maghavan brings comfort in the foray to the religious man who pours libations.<br> 3 Him, verily, the men invoke in combat; risking their lives they make him their protector,<br> When heroes, foe to foe, give up their bodies, fighting, each side, for children and their offspring.<br> 4 Strong God! the folk at need put forth their vigour, striving together in the whirl of battle.<br> When warrior bands encounter one another some in the grapple quit themselves like Indra.<br> 5 Hence many a one worships the might of Indra: hence let the brew succeed the meal-oblation.<br> Hence let the Soma banish those who pour not: even hence I joy to pay the Strong One worship.<br> 6 Indra gives comfort to the man who truly presses, for him who longs <A HREF="errata.htm#15">for</A> it, the Soma,<br> Not disaffected, with devoted spirit this man he takes to be his friend in battles.<br> 7 He who this day for Indra presses Soma, prepares the brew and fries the grains of barley&#151;<br> Loving the hymns of that devoted servant, to him may Indra give heroic vigour.<br> 8 When the impetuous chief hath sought the <A HREF="errata.htm#16">conflict</A>, and the lord looked upon the long-drawn battle,<br> The matron calls to the Strong God whom pressers of Soma have encouraged in the dwelling.<br> 9 He bid a small price for a thing of value: I was content, returning, still unpurchased.<br> He heightened not his insufficient offer. Simple and clever, both milk out the udder.<br> 10 Who for ten milch-kine purchaseth from me this Indra who is mine?<br> When he hath slain the V&#7771;tras let the buyer give him back to me.<br> 11 Now, Indra! lauded, glorified with praises, let wealth swell high like rivers for the singer.<br> For thee a new hymn, Lord of Bays, is fashioned. May we, car-borne, through song be victors ever.</p>
