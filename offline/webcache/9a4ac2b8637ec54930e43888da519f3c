<p>1. THE Child, when blended with the streams, speeding the plan of sacrifice,<br> Surpasses all things that are dear, yea, from of old.<br> 2 The place, near the two pressing-stones of Trita, hath he occupied,<br> Secret and dear through seven lights of sacrifice.<br> 3 Urge to three courses, on the heights of Trita, riches in a stream.<br> He who is passing wise measures his courses out.<br> 4 Even at his birth the Mothers Seven taught him, for glory, like a sage,<br> So that he, firm and sure, hath set his mind on wealth.<br> 5 Under his sway, of one accord, are all the guileless Deities:<br> Warriors to be envied, they, when they are pleased.<br> 6 The Babe whom they who strengthen Law have generated fair to see,<br> Much longed for at the sacrifice, most liberal Sage,&#151;<br> 7 To him, united, of themselves, come the young Parents of the rite,<br> When they adorn him, duly weaving sacrifice.<br> 8 With wisdom and with radiant eyes unbar to us the stall of heaven,<br> Speeding at solemn rite the plan of Holy Law.</p>
