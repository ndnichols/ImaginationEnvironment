<p>1. How, what priest's sacrifice hath he made mighty, rejoicing in the Soma and its fountain?<br> Delighting in juice, eagerly drinking, the Lofty One hath waxed for splendid riches.<br> 2 What hero hath been made his feast-companion? Who hath been partner in his loving-kindness?<br> What know we of his wondrous acts? How often comes he to aid and speed the pious toiler?<br> 3 How heareth Indra offered invocation? How, hearing, marketh he the invoker's wishes?<br> What are his ancient acts of bounty? Wherefore call they him One who filleth full the singer?<br> 4 How doth the priest who laboureth, ever longing, win for himself the wealth which he possesseth?<br> May he, the God, mark well my truthful praises, having received the homage which he loveth.<br> 5 How, and what bond of friendship with a mortal hath the God chosen as this morn is breaking?<br> How, and what love hath he for those who love him, who have entwined in him their firm affection?<br> 6 Is then thy friendship with thy friends most mighty? Thy brotherhood with us,&#151;when may we tell it?<br> The streams of milk move, as most wondrous sunlight, the beauty of the Lovely One for glory.<br> 7 About to stay the Indra-less destructive spirit he sharpens his keen arms to strike her.<br> Whereby the Strong, although our debts&#146; exactor, drives in the distant mornings that we know not.<br> 8 Eternal Law hath varied food that strengthens; thought of eternal Law, removes transgressions.<br> The praise-hymn of eternal Law, arousing, glowing, hath oped the deaf ears of the living.<br> 9 Firm-seated are eternal Law's foundations in its fair form are many splendid beauties.<br> By holy Law long lasting food they bring us; by holy Law have cows come to our worship.<br> 10 Fixing eternal Law he, too, upholds it swift moves the might of Law and wins the booty.<br> To Law belong the vast deep Earth and Heaven: Milch-kine supreme, to Law their milk they render.<br> 11 Now, Indra! lauded,&#151;glorified with praises, let power swell high like rivers to the singer.<br> For thee a new hymn, Lord of Bays, is fashioned. May we, car-borne, through song be victors ever.</p>
