<p>1. THE singers welcome with their hymns and praises the Goddess Dawn who bringeth in the sunlight,<br> Sublime, by Law true to eternal Order, bright on her path, red-tinted, far-refulgent.<br> 2 She comes in front, fair, rousing up the people, making the pathways easy to be travelled.<br> High, on her lofty chariot, all-impelling, Dawn gives her splendour at the days' beginning.<br> 3 She, harnessing her car with purple oxen. injuring none, hath brought perpetual riches.<br> Opening paths to happiness, the Goddess shines, praised by all, giver of every blessing.<br> 4 With changing tints she gleams in double splendour while from the eastward she displays her body.<br> She travels perfectly the path of Order, nor fails to reach, as one who knows, the quarters.<br> 5 As conscious that her limbs are bright with bathing, she stands, as &#146;twere, erect that we may see her.<br> Driving away malignity and darkness, Dawn, Child of Heaven, hath come to us with lustre.<br> 6 The Daughter of the Sky, like some chaste woman, bends, opposite to men, her forehead downward.<br> The Maid, disclosing boons to him who worships, hath brought again the daylight as aforetime.</p>
