<TD><P>And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the      
treasury.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, Of a truth I say   
unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all:</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>For all these have of their 
abundance cast in unto the offerings of ELOHIYM: but she of her penury hath     
cast in all the living that she had.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5>
<H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with  
goodly stones and gifts, he said,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6>   
<H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>As for these things which ye behold, the days will come,  
in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be  
thrown down.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what    
sign will there be when these things shall come to pass?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, Take heed that ye be   
not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am MASHIYACH; and the   
time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>But when ye shall hear of wars and  
commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the 
end is not by and by.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and       
kingdom against kingdom:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and   
pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>But before all  
these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up  
to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for  
my name's sake.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And it shall turn to you for a testimony.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to      
meditate before what ye shall answer:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which   
all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And ye shall be betrayed both 
by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall     
they cause to be put to death.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4> 
17</H4></TD><TD><P>And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>But there shall not  
an hair of your head perish.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>   
19</H4></TD><TD><P>In your patience possess ye your souls.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And when ye shall see Jerusalem   
compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Then let them which  
are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it  
depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>For these be the     
days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>But woe unto them    
that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall 
be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And they shall fall by the edge   
of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem     
shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be       
fulfilled.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and     
upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves      
roaring;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which    
are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And then shall they see   
the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And when these things begin   
to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption      
draweth nigh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees;</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>When they now   
shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at      
hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>So     
likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of 
EL is nigh at hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be  
fulfilled.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>And take heed to     
yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and    
drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>For as a snare  
shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>Watch ye therefore,  
and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things     
that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And in the day time he was    
teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that   
is called the mount of Olives.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4> 
38</H4></TD><TD><P>And all the people came early in the morning to him in the
