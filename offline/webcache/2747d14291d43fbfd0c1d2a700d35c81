And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that 
was before the water gate; and they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the     
book of the law of Moses, which YHVH had commanded to Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And Ezra the priest brought the 
law before the congregation both of men and women, and all that could hear with 
understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And he read therein before the      
street that was before the water gate from the morning until midday, before the 
men and the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of all the     
people were attentive unto the book of the law.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of     
wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and 
Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand;    
and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and       
Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the  
people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the       
people stood up:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And Ezra blessed YHVH, the great ELOHIYM. And all the people answered, Amen, 
Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped   
YHVH with their faces to the ground.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7>
<H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub,       
Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and    
the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people stood in   
their place.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>  
So they read in the book in the law of ELOHIYM distinctly, and gave the sense,  
and caused them to understand the reading.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra    
the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all    
the people, This day is holy unto YHVH your ELOHIYM; mourn not, nor weep. For   
all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Then he said unto them, Go your   
way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom     
nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto our ADOWN: neither be ye sorry;  
for the joy of YHVH is your strength.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>So the Levites stilled all the people, saying,  
Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And all the people went their 
way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth,        
because they had understood the words that were declared unto them.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And on the second    
day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people, the      
priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of 
the law.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
they found written in the law which YHVH had commanded by Moses, that the       
children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month:</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And that they   
should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go   
forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle   
branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it 
is written.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P> 
So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every   
one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the   
house of ELOHIYM, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the 
gate of Ephraim.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the         
captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jeshua   
the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there  
was very great gladness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in   
the book of the law of ELOHIYM. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the  
eighth day was a solemn assembly, according unto the manner.</P></TD></TR>
