<p>1. KANVAS, tell forth with song the deeds of Indra, the Impetuous,<br> Wrought in the Soma's wild delight.<br> 2 Strong God, he slew Anarsani, Srbinda, Pipru, and the fiend,<br> Ah&#299;&#347;uva, and loosed the floods.<br> 3. Thou broughtest down the dwelling-place, the height of lofty Arbuda.<br> That exploit, Indra, must be famed.<br> 4 Bold, to your famous Soma I call the fair-visored God for aid,<br> Down like a torrent from the hill.<br> 5 Rejoicing in the Soma-draughts, Hero, burst open, like a fort,<br> The stall of horses and of kine.<br> 6 If my libation gladdens, if thou takest pleasure in my laud,<br> Come with thy Godhead from afar.<br> 7 O Indra, Lover of the Song, the singers of thy praise are we:<br> O Soma-drinker, quicken us.<br> 8 And, taking thy delight with us bring us still undiminished food:<br> Great is thy wealth, O Maghavan.<br> 9 Make thou us rich in herds of kine, in steeds, in gold: let us exert<br> Our strength in sacrificial gifts.<br> 10 Let us call him to aid whose hands stretch far, to whom high laud is due.<br> Who worketh well to succour us.<br> 11 He, &#346;atakratu, even in fight acts as a V&#7771;tra-slayer s,till:<br> He gives his worshippers much wealth.<br> 12 May he, this A;akra, strengthen us, Boon God who satisfies our needs,<br> Indra, with all lhis saving helps.<br> 13 To him, the mighty stream of wealth, the Soma-presser's rescuing Friend,<br> To Indra sing your song of praise;<br> 14 Who bringeth what is great and firm, who winneth glory in his wars,<br> Lord of vast wealth through power and might.<br> 15 There liveth none to cheek or stay his energies and gracious deeds:<br> None who can say, He giveth not.<br> 16 No debt is due by Brahmans now, by active men who press the juice:<br> Well hath each Soma-draught been paid.<br> 17 Sing ye to him who must be praised, say lauds to him who must be praised,<br> Bring prayer to him who must be praised.<br> 18 May be, unchecked, strong, meet for praise, bring hundreds, thousands forth to light,<br> Indra who aids the worshipper.<br> 19 Go with thy God-like nature forth, go where the folk are calling thee:<br> Drink, Indra, of the drops we pour.<br> 20 Drink milky draughts which are thine own, this too which was with Tugrya once,<br> This is it, Indra, that is thine.<br> 21 Pass him who psours libations out in angry mood or after sin:<br> Here drink the juice we offer thee.<br> 22 Over the three great distances, past the Five Peoples go thy way,<br> O Indra, noticing our voice.<br> 23 Send forth thy ray like S&#363;rya: let my songs attract thee hitherward,<br> Like waters gathering to the vale.<br> 24 Now to the Hero fair of cheek, Adhvaryu, pour the Soma forth:<br> Bring of the juice that he may drink<br> 25 Who cleft the water-cloud in twain, loosed rivers for their downward flow,<br> And set the ripe milk in the kine.<br> 26 He, meet for praise, slew V&#7771;tra, slew Ah&#299;&#347;uva, Urnavabha's son,<br> And pierced th:rough Arbuda with frost.<br> 27 To him your matchless Mighty One, unconquerable Conqueror,<br> Sing forth the prayer which Gods have given:<br> 28 Indra, who in the wild delight of Soma juice considers here<br> All holy Laws among the Gods.<br> 29 Hither let these thy Bays who share thy banquet, Steeds with golden manes,<br> Convey thee to the feast prepared.<br> 30 Hither, O thou whom many laud, the Bays whom Priyamedha praised,<br> Shall bring thee to the Soma-draught.</p>
