<p>1. THEE, verily, O Thunder-wielding Indra, all the Gods here, the Helpers swift to listen,<br> And both the worlds elected, thee the Mighty, High, waxen strong, alone to slaughter V&#7771;tra.<br> 2 The Gods, as worn witheld, relaxed their efforts: thou, Indra, born of truth, wast Sovran Ruler.<br> Thou slewest Ahi who besieged the waters, and duggest out their all-supporting channels.<br> 3 The insatiate one, extended, hard to waken, who slumbered in perpetual sleep, O Indra,&#151;<br> The Dragon stretched against the seven prone rivers, where no joint was, thou rentest with thy thunder.<br> 4 Indra with might shook earth and her foundation as the wind stirs the water with its fury.<br> Striving, with strength he burst the firm asunder, and tore away the summits of the mountains.<br> 5 They ran to thee as mothers to their offspring: the clouds, like chariots, hastened forth together.<br> Thou didst refresh the streams and force the billows: thou, Indra, settest free obstructed rivers.<br> 6 Thou for the sake of Vayya and Turv&#299;ti didst stay the great stream, flowing, all-sustaining:<br> Yea, at their prayer didst check the rushing river and make the floods easy to cross, O Indra.<br> 7 He let the young Maids skilled in Law, unwedded, like fountains, bubbling, flow forth streaming onward.<br> He inundated thirsty plains and deserts, and milked the dry Cows of the mighty master.<br> 8 Through many a morn and many a lovely autumn, having slain V&#7771;tra, he set free the rivers.<br> Indra hath set at liberty to wander on earth the streams encompassed pressed together.<br> 9 Lord of Bay Steeds, thou broughtest from the ant-hill the unwedded damsel's son whom ants were eating.<br> The blind saw clearly, as he grasped the serpent, rose, brake the jar: his joints again united.<br> 10 To the wise man, O Sage and Sovran Ruler, the man who knoweth all thine ancient exploits.<br> Hath told these deeds of might as thou hast wrought them, great acts, spontaneous, and to man's advantage.<br> 11 Now, Indra! lauded, glorified with praises, let powers swell high, like rivers, for the singer.<br> For thee a new hymn, Lord of Bays! is fashioned. May we, car-borne, through song be victors ever.</p>
