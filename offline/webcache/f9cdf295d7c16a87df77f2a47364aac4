<p>1. THY gladdening draughts, O Pavamana, urged by song flow swiftly of themselves like sons of fleet-foot mares.<br> The drops of Soma juice, those eagles of the heavens, most cheering, rich in meath, rest in the reservoir.<br> 2 As rapid chariot-steeds, so turned in several ways have thine exhilarating juices darted forth,<br> Soma-drops rich in meath, waves, to the Thunder-armed, to Indra, like milch-kine who seek their calf with milk.<br> 3 Like a steed urged to battle, finder of the light; speed onward to the cloud-born reservoir of heaven,<br> A Steer that o&#146;er the woolly surface seeks the sieve, Soma while purified for Indra's nourishment.<br> 4 Fleet as swift steeds, thy drops, divine, thought-swift, have been, O Pavamana, poured with milk into the vat.<br> The &#7770;&#7779;is have poured in continuous Soma drops, ordainers who adorn thee, Friend whom &#7770;&#7779;is love.<br> 5 O thou who seest all things, Sovran as thou art and passing strong, thy rays encompass all abodes.<br> Pervading with thy natural powers thou flowest on, and as the whole world's Lord, O Soma, thou art King.<br> 6 The beams of Pavamana, sent from earth and heaven, his ensigns

sacrifice: Soma advances to the special place of Gods.<br> He speeds with thousand currents to the reservoir, and passes through the filter bellowing as a bull.<br> 8 The Sovran dips him in the seain and the streams, and set in rivers with the waters' wave moves on.<br> High heaven's Sustainer at the central point of earth, raised on the fleecy surface Pavamana stands.<br> 9 He on whose high decree the heavens and earth depend nath roared and thundered like the summit of the sky.<br> Soma flows on obtaining Indra's friendly love, and, as they purify him, settles in the jars.<br> 10 He,

made beautiful by rivers and by sheep.<br> 12 In forefront of the rivers Pavamana speeds, in forefront of the hymn, foremost among the kine.<br> He shares the mighty booty in the van of war: the well-armed Steer is purified by worshippers.<br> 13 This heedful Pavamana, like a bird sent forth, hath with his wave flowed onward to the fleecy sieve.<br> O Indra, through thy wisdom, b thy thought, O Sage, Soma flows bright and pure between the earth and heaven.<br> 14 He, clad in mail that reaches heaven, the Holy One, filling the firmament stationed amid the worlds,<br> Knowing. the realm of light, hath come to us in rain: he summons to himself his own primeval Sire.<br> 15 He who was first of all to penetrate his form bestowed upon his race wide shelter and defence.<br> From that high

meet.<br> Worshippers have exalted Soma with their hymns, and milch kine have come near to meet him with their milk.<br> 18 O Soma, Indu, while they cleanse thee, pour on us accumulateds Plentiful, nutritious food,<br> Which, ceaseless, thrice a day shall yield us hero power enriched with store of nourishment, and strength, and Meath.<br> 19 Far-seeing Soma flows, the Steer, the Lord of hymns, the Furtherer of day, of morning, and of heaven.<br> Mixt with the streams he caused the beakers to resound, and with the singers' aid they entered Indra's heart.<br> 20 On, with the prudent singers, flows the ancient Sage and guided by the men hath roared about the vats.<br> Producing Trita's name, may he pour forth the meath, that V&#257;yu and that Indra may become his Friends.<br> 21 He, being

finds sweet.<br> 22 Flow, onward, Soma, in thine own celestial forms, flow, Indu, poured within the beaker and the sieve.<br> Sinking into the throat of Indra with a roar, led by the men thou madest S&#363;rya mount to heaven.<br> 23 Pressed out with stones thou flowest onward to the sieve, O Indu, entering the depths of Indra's throat.<br> Far-sighted Soma, now thou lookest on mankind: thou didst unbar the cowstall for the A&#7749;girases.<br> 24 In thee, O Soma, while thou purifitedst thee, high-thoughted sages, seeking favour, have rejoiced.<br> Down from the heavens the Falcon brought thee hitherward, even thee, O Indu, thee whom all our hymns adorn.<br> 25 Seven Milch-kine glorify the Tawny-coloured One while with his wave in wool he purifies himself.<br> The living men, the mighty, have impelled the Sage into the waters' lap, the place of sacrifice.<br> 26 Indu, attaining purity, plunges through the foe, making Ilis ways all easy for the pious man.<br> Making the kine

forth for thee milk and oil rich in sweets: O Soma, let the folk abide in thy decree.<br> 38 O Soma, thou beholdest men from every side: O Pavamana, Steer, thou wanderest through these.<br> Pour out upon us wealth in treasure and in gold: may we have strength to live among the things that be.<br> 39 Winner of gold and goods and cattle flow thou on, set as impregner, Indu, mid the worlds of life.<br> Rich in brave men art thou, Soma, who winnest all: these holy singers wait upon thee with the song.<br> 40 The wave of flowing meath hath wakened up desires: the Steer enrobed in milk plunges into the streams.<br> Borne on his chariot-sieve the King hath risen to war, and with a thousand rays hath won him high renown.<br> 41 Dear to all life, he sends triumphant praises forth, abundant, bringing offspring, each succeeding day.<br> From Indra crave for us, Indu, when thou art quaffed, the blessing that gives children, wealth that harbours steeds.<br> 42 When days begin, the strong juice, lovely, golden-hued, is recognized by wisdom more and more each day,<br> He, stirring both the Races, goes between the two, the bearer of the word of men and word of Gods.<br> 43 They balm him, balm him over balm him thoroughly, caress the mighty strength and balm it with the meath.<br> They seize the flying Steer at the stream's breathing-place: cleansing with gold they grasp the Animal herein.<br> 44 Sing forth to Pavamana skilled in holy song: the juice is flowing onward like a mighty stream.<br> He.glideth like a serpent from his ancient skin, and like a playful horse the Tawny Steer hath run.<br> 45 Dweller in floods, King, foremost, he displays his might, set among living things as measurer of days.<br> Distilling oil he flows, fair, billowy, golden-hued, borne on a car of light, sharing one hom-e with wealth.<br> 46 Loosed is the heavens! support, the uplifted cheering juice: the triply-mingled draught flows round into the worlds.<br> The holy hymns caress the stalk that claims our praise, when singers have approached his beauteous robe with song.<br> 47 Thy strearns that flow forth rapidly collected run over the fine fleece of the sheep as thou art cleansed.<br> When, Indu, thou art. balmed with milk within the bowl, thou sinkest in the jars, O Soma, when expressed.<br> 48 Winner of power, flow, Soma, worthy of our laud: run onward to the fleece as well-beloved meath.<br> Destroy, O Indu, all voracious R&#257;k&#7779;asas.
