all Jerusalem with him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the   
people together, he demanded of them where MASHIYACH should be born.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And they said unto     
him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And thou Bethlehem, in 
the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee

appeared.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young

worship him also.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD>
<P>When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they

unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

when they were departed, behold, the angel of YHVH appeareth to Joseph in a     
dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into    
Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young 
child to destroy him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and 
departed into Egypt:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4>

which was spoken of YHVH by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my  
son.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Then    
Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and 
sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the    
coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he    
had diligently enquired of the wise men.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A
