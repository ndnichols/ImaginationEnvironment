<p>1. STRONG P&#363;&#7779;an's majesty is lauded evermore, the glory of his lordly might is never faint, his song of praise is never faint.<br> Seeking felicity I laud him nigh to help, the source, of bliss,<br> Who, Vigorous one, hath drawn to him the hearts of all, drawn them, the Vigorous One, the God.<br> 2 Thee, then, O P&#363;&#7779;an, like a swift one on his way, I urge with lauds that thou mayst make the foemen flee, drive, camel-like, our foes afar.<br> As I, a man, call thee, a God, giver of bliss, to be my Friend,<br> So make our loudly-chanted praises glorious, in battles make them glorious.<br> 3 Thou, P&#363;&#7779;an, in whose friendship they who sing forth praise enjoy advantage, even in wisdom, through thy grace, in wisdom even they are advanced.<br> So, after this most recent course, we come to thee with prayers for wealth.<br> Not stirred to anger, O Wide-Ruler, come to us, come thou to us in every fight.<br> 4 Not stirred to anger, come, Free-giver, nigh to us, to take this gift of ours, thou who hast goats for steeds, Goat-borne! their gift who long for fame.<br> So, Wonder-Worker! may we turn thee hither with effectual lauds.<br> I slight thee not, O P&#363;&#7779;an, thou Resplendent One: thy friendship may not be despised.</p>
