<p>1. LARGE was that covering, and firm of texture, folded wherein thou enteredst the waters.<br> One Deity alone, O J&#257;tavedas Agni, saw all thy forms in sundry places.<br> 2 What God hath seen me? Who of all their number clearly beheld my forms in many places?<br> Where lie, then, all the sacred logs of Agni that lead him God-ward, Varu&#7751;a and Mitra?<br> 3 In many places, Agni J&#257;tavedas, we sought thee hidden in the plants and waters.<br> Then Yama marked thee, God of wondrous splendour! effulgent from thy tenfold secret dwelling,<br> 4 I fled in fear from sacrificial worship, Varu&#7751;a, lest the Gods should thus engage me.<br> Thus were my forms laid down in many places. This, as my goal, I Agni saw before me.<br> 5 Come; man is pious and would fain do worship, he waits prepared: in gloom thou, Agni, dwellest.<br> Make pathways leading God-ward clear and easy, and bear oblations with a kindly spirit.<br> 6 This goal mine elder brothers erst selected, as he who drives a car the way to travel.<br> So,Varu&#7751;a, I fled afar through terror, as flies the wild-bull from an archer's bowstring.<br> 7 We give thee life unwasting, J&#257;tavedas, so that, employed, thou never shalt be injured.<br> So, nobly born! shalt thou with kindly spirit bear to the Gods their share of men's oblations.<br> 8 Grant me the first oblations and the latter, entire, my forceful shares of holy presents,<br> The soul of plants, the fatness of the waters, and let there be long life, ye Gods, to Agni.<br> 9 Thine be the first oblations and the latter, entire, thy forceful shares of holy presents.<br> Let all this sacrifice be thine, O Agni, and let the world's four regions how before thee.</p>
