<TD><P>And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah    
and of Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And the king went up into the house of YHVH, and all the men of Judah and    
all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets,   
and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the     
words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of YHVH.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And the king stood by  
a pillar, and made a covenant before YHVH, to walk after YHVH, and to keep his  
commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all  
their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this     
book. And all the people stood to the covenant.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And the king commanded Hilkiah the high        
priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to    
bring forth out of the temple of YHVH all the vessels that were made for Baal,  
and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them without   
Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto           
Bethel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And he 
put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn   
incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round      
about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to    
the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And he brought out the grove    
from the house of YHVH, without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it 
at the brook Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder        
thereof upon the graves of the children of the people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And he brake down the houses of the 
sodomites, that were by the house of YHVH, where the women wove hangings for    
the grove.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high     
places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba, and brake  
down the high places of the gates that were in the entering in of the gate of   
Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man's left hand at the gate of 
the city.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>     
Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of YHVH in 
Jerusalem, but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And he defiled  
Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might    
make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And he took away the      
horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the  
house of YHVH, by the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the 
suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And the altars that were on the   
top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the    
altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of YHVH, did the  
king beat down, and brake them down from thence, and cast the dust of them into 
the brook Kidron.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right  
hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had builded   
for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination 
of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did   
the king defile.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and filled   
their places with the bones of men.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15>
<H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high      
place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both   
that altar and the high place he brake down, and burned the high place, and     
stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And as Josiah turned himself, he  
spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones 
out of the sepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and polluted it,         
according to the word of YHVH which the man of ELOHIYM proclaimed, who          
proclaimed these words.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>Then he said, What title is that that I see? And the men of the     
city told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of ELOHIYM, which came from       
Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of     
Bethel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, 
with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And all the houses also of the    
high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had   
made to provoke to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all    
the acts that he had done in Bethel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And he slew all the priests of the high places  
that were there upon the altars, and burned men's bones upon them, and returned 
to Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto YHVH   
your ELOHIYM, as it is written in the book of this covenant.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Surely there was not holden   
such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the  
days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>But in the eighteenth year of     
king Josiah, wherein this passover was holden to YHVH in Jerusalem.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover the workers 
with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all  
the abominations that were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did     
Josiah put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written  
in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of YHVH.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And like unto him was     
there no king before him, that turned to YHVH with all his heart, and with all  
his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither    
after him arose there any like him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26>
<H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>Notwithstanding YHVH turned not from the fierceness of   
his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all  
the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH said, I will remove      
Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and will cast off this    
city Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said, My name      
shall be there.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD>
<P>Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not        
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>In his days Pharaohnechoh     
king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and   
king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen      
him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And his 
servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to         
Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the people of the land took 
Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's 
stead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>      
Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned  
three months in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of   
Jeremiah of Libnah.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And he did that which was evil in the sight of YHVH, according to all    
that his fathers had done.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>     
33</H4></TD><TD><P>And Pharaohnechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of  
Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of  
an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim

Jehoiakim, and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And Jehoiakim   
gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the      
money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the    
gold of the people of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give 
it unto Pharaohnechoh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4>
