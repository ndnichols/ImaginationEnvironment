And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great      
persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all        
scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the       
apostles.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over       
him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>As for    
Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men   
and women committed them to prison.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4> 
<H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every      
where preaching the word.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached          
MASHIYACH unto them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip  
spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>For unclean spirits, crying with    
loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with 
palsies, and that were lame, were healed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And there was great joy in that city.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>But there was a        
certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and  
bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>To whom they    
all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great    
power of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched   
them with sorceries.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the   
kingdom of EL, and the name of YAHSHUA MASHIYACH, they were baptized, both men  
and women.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with   
Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Now when the         
apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of    
ELOHIYM, they sent unto them Peter and John:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, 
that they might receive the Holy Ghost:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them:    
only they were baptized in the name of the ADONAY YAHSHUA.)</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Then laid they their hands on 
them, and they received the Holy Ghost.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And when Simon saw that through laying on of    
the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Saying, Give me also 
this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>But Peter said  
unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift   
of ELOHIYM may be purchased with money.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter:  
for thy heart is not right in the sight of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Repent therefore of this thy      
wickedness, and pray ELOHIYM, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be      
forgiven thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of   
iniquity.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to YHVH for me, that none of these       
things which ye have spoken come upon me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And they, when they had testified and preached  
the word of YHVH, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many        
villages of the Samaritans.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>    
26</H4></TD><TD><P>And the angel of YHVH spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and  
go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza,      
which is desert.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of      
great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of    
all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Was returning, and sitting in 
his chariot read Esaias the prophet.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and  
join thyself to this chariot.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>  
30</H4></TD><TD><P>And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the        
prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, How can I,   
except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up    
and sit with him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep 
to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his 
mouth:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>In    
his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his          
generation? for his life is taken from the earth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>And the eunuch answered Philip,   
and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of     
some other man?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD>
<P>Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached  
unto him YAHSHUA.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the   
eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And Philip said, If  
thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I   
believe that YAHSHUA MASHIYACH is the Son of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>And he commanded the chariot to   
stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the        
eunuch; and he baptized him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>   
39</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of   
YHVH caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his    
way rejoicing.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the   
cities, till he came to Caesarea.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
