<p>1. HITHERWARD have I called to-day, for succour, that most wondrous car<br> Which ye ascended, A&#347;vins, ye whose paths are red, swift to give Car, for S&#363;rya's sake.<br> 2 Car ever young, much longed-for, easily invoked, soon guided, first in deeds of might,<br> Which waits and serves, O Sobhari, with benevolence, without a rival or a foe.<br> 3 These A&#347;vins with our homage, these Two Omnipresent Deities<br> Hitherward will we bring for kind help, these who seek the dwelling of the worshipper.<br> 4 One of your chariot wheels is moving swiftly round, one speeds for you its onward course.<br> Like a milch-cow, O Lords of splendour, and with haste let your benevolence come to us.<br> 5 That chariot of yours which hath a triple seat and reins of gold,<br> The famous car that traverseth the heaven and earth, thereon N&#257;satyas, A&#347;vins, come.<br> 6 Ye with your plough, when favouring Manu with your help, ploughed the first harvest in the sky.<br> As such will we exalt you, Lords of splendour, now, O A&#347;vins, with our prayer and praise.<br> 7 Come to us, Lords of ample wealth, by paths of everlasting Law,<br> Whereby to high dominion ye with mighty strength raised Trksi, Trasadasyu's son.<br> 8 This Soma pressed with stones is yours, ye Heroes, Lords of plenteous wealth.<br> Approach to drink the Soma, come, drink in the worshipper's abode.<br> 9 O A&#347;vins, mount the chariot, mount the golden seat, ye who are Lords of plenteous wealth,<br> And bring to us abundant food.<br> 10 The aids wherewith ye helped Paktha and Adhrigt;, and Babhru severed from his friends,&#151;<br> With those, O A&#347;vins, come hither with speed and soon, and heal whatever is diseased.<br> 11 When we continually invoke the A&#347;vins, the resistless, at this time of day,<br> We lovers of the song, with songs.<br> 12 Through these, ye Mighty Ones, come hither to my call which brings all blessings, wears all forms,&#151;<br> Tlirough which, All-present Heroes, lavishest of food ye strengthened Krvi, come through these.<br> 13 I speak to both of these as such, these A&#347;vins whom I reverence at this time of day:<br> With homage we entreat them both.<br> 14 Ye who are Lords of splendour, ye whose paths are red, at eve, at mom, at sacrifice,<br> Give us not utterly as prey to mortal foe, ye Rudras, Lords of ample wealth.<br> 15 For bliss I call. the blissful car, at morn the inseparable A&#347;vins with their car<br> I call, like Sobhari our sire.<br> 16 Rapid as thought, and strong, and speeding to thejoy, bringing.your swiftly-coming help,<br> Be to us a protection even from far away Lords of great wealth, with many aids.'<br> 17 Come, Wonder-Workers, to our home, our home, O A&#347;vins, rich in cattle, steeds, and gold,<br> Chief drinkers of the Soma's juice<br> 18 Choice-worthy strength, heroic, firm and excellent, uninjured by the Rak&#7779;as foe,<br> At this your coming nigh, ye Lords of ample wealth and all good things, may we obtain.</p>
