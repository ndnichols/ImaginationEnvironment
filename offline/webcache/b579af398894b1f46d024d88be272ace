<TD><P>And the child Samuel ministered unto YHVH before Eli. And the word of    
YHVH was precious in those days; there was no open vision.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass at that time,   
when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he     
could not see;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>
And ere the lamp of ELOHIYM went out in the temple of YHVH, where the ark of    
ELOHIYM was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>That YHVH called Samuel: and he answered, Here 
am I.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And he   
ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called  
not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel  
arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he      
answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Now Samuel did not yet know YHVH, neither was  
the word of YHVH yet revealed unto him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

perceived that YHVH had called the child.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and 
it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, YHVH; for thy servant 
heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH came, and stood, and

both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>In that day I will perform        
against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin,  
I will also make an end.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4>
</TD><TD><P>For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the    
iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he        
restrained them not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4>

</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And Samuel lay

And he said, What is the thing that hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide it    
not from me: ELOHIYM do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from  
me of all the things that he said unto thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

YHVH appeared again in Shiloh: for YHVH revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by
