Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; 
as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and        
Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>As they ministered to  
YHVH, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the    
work whereunto I have called them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3>  
<H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands 
on them, they sent them away.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>

Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they were at Salamis, they 
preached the word of ELOHIYM in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also   
John to their minister.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a   
certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-iesous.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Which was with the     
deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas

VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is

from the faith.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his    
eyes on him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>
And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the devil,     
thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways  
of YHVH?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
now, behold, the hand of YHVH is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing 
the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness;  
and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the deputy, when he saw what 
was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the ADONAY.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Now when Paul and    
his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John       
departing from them returned to Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat     
down.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent  
unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for  
the people, say on.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and 
ye that fear ELOHIYM, give audience.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And about the time of forty years

judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the        
prophet.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And

</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And as John

ELOHIYM, to you is the word of this salvation sent.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning        
him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And     
though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he

the promise which was made unto the fathers,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>And as concerning that he

<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>Behold, ye despisers, and

<A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the Jews were gone out of the       
synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the 
next sabbath.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious      
proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to 
continue in the grace of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44>  
<H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city

filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul,     
contradicting and blaspheming.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46><H4> 
46</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was          
necessary that the word of ELOHIYM should first have been spoken to you: but    
seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life,   
lo, we turn to the Gentiles.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>

the earth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V48><H4>48</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of     
YHVH: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V49><H4>49</H4></TD><TD><P>And the word of YHVH was      
published throughout all the region.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against 
Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V51><H4>51</H4></TD><TD><P>But they shook off the dust of    
their feet against them, and came unto Iconium.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
