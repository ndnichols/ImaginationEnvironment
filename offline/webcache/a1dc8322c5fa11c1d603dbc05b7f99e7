<p>1. Do homage unto Varu&#7751;a's and Mitra's Eye: offer this solemn worship to the Mighty God,<br> Who seeth far away, the Ensign, born of Gods. Sing praises unto S&#363;rya, to the Son of Dyaus.<br> 2 May this my truthful speech guard me on every side wherever heaven and earth and days are spread abroad.<br> All else that is in motion finds a place of rest: the waters ever flow and ever mounts the Sun.<br> 3 No godless man from time remotest draws thee down when thou art driving forth with winged dappled Steeds.<br> One lustre waits upon thee moving to the cast, and, S&#363;rya, thou arisest with a different light.<br> 4 O S&#363;rya, with the light whereby thou scatterest gloom, and with thy ray impellest every moving thing,<br> Keep far from us all feeble, worthless sacrifice, and drive away disease and every evil dream.<br> 5 Sent forth thou guardest well the Universe's law, and in thy wonted way arisest free from wrath.<br> When S&#363;rya, we address our prayers to thee to-day, may the Gods favour this our purpose and desire.<br> 6 This invocation, these our words may Heaven and Earth, and Indra and the Waters and the Maruts hear.<br> Ne&#146;er may we suffer want in presence of the Sun, and, living happy lives, may we attain old age.<br> 7 Cheerful in spirit, evermore, and keen of sight, with store of children, free from sickness and from sin,<br> Long-living, may we look, O S&#363;rya, upon thee uprising day by day, thou great as Mitra is!<br> 8 S&#363;rya, may we live long and look upon thee still, thee, O Far-seeing One, bringing the glorious light,<br> The radiant God, the spring of joy to every eye, as thou art mounting up o&#146;er the high shining flood.<br> 9 Thou by whose lustre all the world of life comes forth, and by thy beams again returns unto its rest,<br> O S&#363;rya with the golden hair, ascend for us day after day, still bringing purer innocence.<br> 10 Bless us with shine, bless us with perfect daylight, bless us with cold, with fervent heat and lustre.<br> Bestow on us, O S&#363;rya, varied riches, to bless us in our home and when we travel.<br> 11 Gods, to our living creatures of both kinds vouchsafe protection, both to bipeds and to quadrupeds,<br> That they may drink and eat invigorating food. So grant us health and strength and perfect innocence.<br> 12 If by some grievous sin we have provoked the Gods, O Deities, with the tongue or thoughtlessness of heart,<br> That guilt, O Vasus, lay upon the Evil One, on him who ever leads us into deep distress.</p>
