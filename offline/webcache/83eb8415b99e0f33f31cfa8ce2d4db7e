1</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA answered and spake unto them again by parables,   
and said,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>The  
kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his    
son,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And sent  
forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would 
not come.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>     
Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden,        
Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all  
things are ready: come unto the marriage.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>But they made light of it, and went their ways,   
one to his farm, another to his merchandise:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And the remnant took his servants, and entreated  
them spitefully, and slew them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4> 
7</H4></TD><TD><P>But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent    
forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Then saith he to  
his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not         
worthy.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Go ye  
therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the           
marriage.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>So 
those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as 
they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the    
king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding   
garment:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding       
garment? And he was speechless.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>
13</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot,  
and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness, there shall be weeping and 
gnashing of teeth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>For many are called, but few are chosen.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel    
how they might entangle him in his talk.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And they sent out unto him their disciples with 
the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way 
of ELOHIYM in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not    
the person of men.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto 
Caesar, or not?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD>
<P>But YAHSHUA perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye        
hypocrites?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And he saith unto them, Whose 
is this image and superscription?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21>  
<H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them,    
Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto ELOHIYM    
the things that are EL's.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>      
22</H4></TD><TD><P>When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left    
him, and went their way.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4>
</TD><TD><P>The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no  
resurrection, and asked him,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>   
24</H4></TD><TD><P>Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no          
children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his          
brother.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Now 
there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife,   
deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>Likewise the second also, 
and the third, unto the seventh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27>   
<H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And last of all the woman died also.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore in the resurrection 
whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA answered and said     
unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of ELOHIYM.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>For in the      
resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the      
angels of ELOHIYM in heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>   
31</H4></TD><TD><P>But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not    
read that which was spoken unto you by ELOHIYM, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>I am the ELOHIYM of Abraham, and  
the ELOHIYM of Isaac, and the ELOHIYM of Jacob? ELOHIYM is not the ELOHIYM of   
the dead, but of the living.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>   
33</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at   
his doctrine.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence,   
they were gathered together.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>   
35</H4></TD><TD><P>Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question,  
tempting him, and saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>      
36</H4></TD><TD><P>Master, which is the great commandment in the law?</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA said unto    
him, Thou shalt love YHVH thy ELOHIYM with all thy heart, and with all thy      
soul, and with all thy mind.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>   
38</H4></TD><TD><P>This is the first and great commandment.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>And the second is like unto   
it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>On these two commandments hang all the law   
and the prophets.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>While the Pharisees were gathered together, YAHSHUA asked them,</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>Saying, What think   
ye of MASHIYACH? whose son is he? They say unto him, The son of David.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>He saith unto them,  
How then doth David in spirit call him ADOWN, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>YHVH said unto my ADOWN, Sit thou 
on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P>If David then call him ADOWN, how 
is he his son?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46><H4>46</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that    
day forth ask him any more questions.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
