<p>1. WHETHER, O A&#347;vins, ye this day be far remote or near at hand,<br> In many spots or in mid-air, come hither, Lords of ample wealth.<br> 2 These here, who show o&#146;er widest space, bringing full many a wondrous act,<br> Resistless, lovingly I seek, I call the Mightiest to enjoy.<br> 3 Another beauteous wheel have ye fixed there to decorate your car.<br> With others through the realms ye roam in might unto the neighbouring tribes.<br> 4 That deed of yours that is extolled, Visvas! hath all been done with this.<br> Born otherwise, and spotless, ye have entered kinship's bonds with us.<br> 5 When S&#363;rya mounted on your car that rolls for ever rapidly,<br> Birds of red hue were round about and burning splendours compassed you.<br> 6 Atri bethinks himself of you, O Heroes, with a friendly mind,<br> What time, N&#257;satyas, with his mouth he stirs the spotless flame for you.<br> 7 Strong is your swiftly moving steed, famed his exertion in the course<br> When by your great deeds, A&#347;vins, Chiefs, Atri is brought to us again.<br> 8 Lovers of sweetness, Rudras, she who streams with sweetness waits on you.<br> When ye have travelled through the seas men bring you gifts of well-dressed food.<br> 9 A&#347;vins, with truth they call you Twain bestowers of felicity;<br> At sacrifice most prompt to hear, most gracious ye at sacrifice.<br> 10 Most pleasing to the A&#347;vins be these prayers which magnify their might,<br> Which we have fashioned, even as cars high reverence have we spoken forth.</p>
