Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off

pursue thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>A

Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.</P></TD></TR>

together.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And

haughtiness of his heart.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>      
30</H4></TD><TD><P>I know his wrath, saith YHVH; but it shall not be so; his

even to the sea of Jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon 
thy vintage.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>
And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of    
Moab, and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread     
with shouting; their shouting shall be no shouting.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

shall be desolate.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD>

<TD><P>There shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab, and

pleasure, saith YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4>

He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up    
out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon it, even upon 
Moab, the year of their visitation, saith YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P>They that fled stood under the shadow of     
Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a

crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith YHVH. Thus far is the
