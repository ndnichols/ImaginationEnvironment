<TD><P>Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and reigned fifty  
and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hephzibah.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And he did that which was   
evil in the sight of YHVH, after the abominations of the heathen, whom YHVH     
cast out before the children of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>For he built up again the high places which       
Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a 
grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and   
served them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And he built altars in the house of YHVH, of which YHVH said, In Jerusalem will 
I put my name.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>
And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house   
of YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used             
enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he wrought much      
wickedness in the sight of YHVH, to provoke him to anger.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And he set a graven image of the    
grove that he had made in the house, of which YHVH said to David, and to        
Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of    
all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Neither will I make the feet of     
Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they   
will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according   
to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>But they hearkened not: and         
Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom YHVH destroyed  
before the children of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4> 
10</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH spake by his servants the prophets, saying,</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Because Manasseh     
king of Judah hath done these abominations, and hath done wickedly above all    
that the Amorites did, which were before him, and hath made Judah also to sin   
with his idols:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD>
<P>Therefore thus saith YHVH ELOHIYM of Israel, Behold, I am bringing such evil 
upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall     
tingle.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house 
of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it, and       
turning it upside down.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver     
them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil   
to all their enemies;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>Because they have done that which was evil in my sight, and have    
provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even 
unto this day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled          
Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith he made Judah to    
sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Now the rest of the acts of       
Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written 
in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And Manasseh slept with his       
fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza:  
and Amon his son reigned in his stead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Amon was twenty and two years old when he began 
to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was      
Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And he did that which was evil in the sight  
of YHVH, as his father Manasseh did.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And he walked in all the way that his father    
walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And he forsook  
YHVH ELOHIYM of his fathers, and walked not in the way of YHVH.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And the servants of Amon  
conspired against him, and slew the king in his own house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And the people of the land slew   
all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made  
Josiah his son king in his stead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25>  
<H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they  
not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And he was buried in his  
sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his stead.</P>
