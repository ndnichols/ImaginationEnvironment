<p>1. FOR you I call the glorious refulgent Agni, the guest of men, rich in oblations<br> Whom all must strive to win even as a lover, God among godly people, J&#257;tavedas.<br> 2 Bh&#7771;gus who served him in the home of waters set him of old in houses of the living.<br> Over all worlds let Agni be the Sovran, the messenger of Gods with rapid coursers.<br> 3 Among the tribes of men the Gods placed Agni as a dear Friend when they would dwell among them.<br> Against the longing nights may he shine brightly, and show the offerer in the house his vigour.<br> 4 Sweet is his growth as of one's own possessions; his look when rushing fain to burn is lovely.<br> He darts his tongue forth, like a harnessed courser who shakes his flowing tail, among the bushes.<br> 5 Since they who honour me have praised my greatness,&#151;he gave, as &#146;twere, his hue to those who love him.<br> Known is he by his bright delightful splendour, and waxing old renews his youth for ever.<br> 6 Like one athirst, he lighteth up the forests; like water down the chariot ways he roareth.<br> On his black path he shines in burning beauty, marked as it were the heaven that smiles through vapour.<br> 7 Around, consuming the broad earth, he wanders, free roaming like an ox without a herdsman,&#151;<br> Agni refulgent, burning up the bushes, with blackened lines, as though the earth he seasoned.<br> 8 I, in remembrance of thine ancient favour have sung my hymn in this our third assembly.<br> O Agni, give us wealth with store of heroes and mighty strength in food and noble offspring.<br> 9 May the G&#7771;tsamadas, serving in secret, through thee, O Agni, overcome their neighbours,<br> Rich in good heroes and subduing foemen. That vital power give thou to chiefs and singers.</p>
