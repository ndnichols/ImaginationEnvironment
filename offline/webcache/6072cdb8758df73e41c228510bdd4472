<p>1. REVERING in our heart Agni Vai&#347;v&#257;nara, the finder of the light, whose promises are true,<br> The liberal, gladsome, car-borne God we Ku&#347;ikas invoke him with oblation, seeking wealth with songs.<br> 2 That Agni, bright, Vai&#347;v&#257;nara, we invoke for help, and M&#257;tari&#347;van worthy of the song of praise;<br> B&#7771;haspati for man's observance of the Gods, the Singer prompt to hear, the swiftly-moving guest.<br> 3 Age after age Vai&#347;v&#257;nara, neighing like a horse, is kindled with the women by the Ku&#347;ikas.<br> May Agni, he who wakes among Immortal Gods, grant us heroic strength and wealth in noble steeds.<br> 4 Let them go forth, the strong, as flames of fire with might. Gathered for victory they have yoked their spotted deer.<br> Pourers of floods, the Maruts, Masters of all wealth, they who can ne&#146;er be conquered, make the mountains shake.<br> 5 The Maruts, Friends of men, are glorious as the fire: their mighty and resplendent succour we implore.<br> Those storming Sons of Rudra clothed in robes of rain, boon-givers of good gifts, roar as the lions roar.<br> 6 We, band on band and troop following troop, entreat with fair lauds Agni's splendour and the Maruts&#146; might,<br> With spotted deer for steeds, with wealth that never fails, they, wise Ones, come to sacrifice at our gatherings.<br> 7 Agni am I who know, by birth, all creatures. Mine eye is butter, in my mouth is nectar.<br> I am light threefold, measurer of the region exhaustless heat am I, named burnt-oblation.<br> 8 Bearing in mind a thought with light accordant, he purified the Sun with three refinings;<br> By his own nature gained the highest treasure, and looked abroad over the earth and heaven.<br> 9 The Spring that fails not with a hundred streamlets, Father inspired of prayers that men should utter,<br> The Sparkler, joyous in his Parents' bosorn, -him, the Truth-speaker, sate ye, Earth and Heaven.</p>
