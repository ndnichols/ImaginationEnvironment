ye my work in the ADONAY?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4>

Have we not power to eat and to drink?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

<A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Who goeth a warfare any time at his own        
charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who   
feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Say I these things as a man? or     
saith not the law the same also?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>
9</H4></TD><TD><P>For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle  
the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth YHVH take care for         
oxen?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Or     
saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: 
that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope    
should be partaker of his hope.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>
11</H4></TD><TD><P>If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great     
thing if we shall reap your carnal things?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>If others be partakers of this power over you,  
are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all     
things, lest we should hinder the gospel of MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Do ye not know that they which    
minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which     
wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Even so hath the ADONAY ordained that they   
which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>But I have used none of these     
things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: 
for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying     
void.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>For    
though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid   
upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>For if I do this thing willingly, 
I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is        
committed unto me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may     
make the gospel of MASHIYACH without charge, that I abuse not my power in the   
gospel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>For  
though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I  
might gain the more.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to 
them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are  
under the law;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to      
ELOHIYM, but under the law to MASHIYACH,) that I might gain them that are       
without law.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>
To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things  
to all men, that I might by all means save some.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And this I do for the gospel's    
sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Know ye not that they which run   
in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And every man   
that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to     
obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>But I keep under my body, and     
bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to       
others, I myself should be a castaway.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software
