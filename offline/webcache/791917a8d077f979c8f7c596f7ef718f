<p>1. As &#146;twere the name of father, easy to invoke, we all assembled here invoke this Car of yours,<br> A&#347;vins, your swiftly-rolling circumambient Car which he who worships must invoke at eve and dawn.<br> 2 Awake all pleasant strains and let the hymns flow forth: raise up abundant fulness: this is our desire.<br> A&#347;vins, bestow on us a glorious heritage, and give our princes treasure fair as Soma is.<br> 3 Ye are the bliss of her who groweth old at home, and helpers of the slow although he linger last.<br> Men call you too, N&#257;satyas, healers of the blind, the thin and feeble, and the man with broken bones.<br> 4 Ye made Cyav&#257;na, weak and worn with length of days, young again, like a car, that he had power to move.<br> Ye lifted up the son of Tugra from the floods. At our libations must all these your acts be praised.<br> 5 We will declare among the folk your ancient deeds heroic; yea, ye were Physicians bringing health.<br> You, you who must be lauded, will we bring for aid, so that this foe of ours, O A&#347;vins, may believe.<br> 6 Listen to me, O A&#347;vins; I have cried to you. Give me-your aid as sire and mother aid their son.<br> Poor, without kin or friend or ties of blood am I. Save me before it be too late, from this my curse.<br> 7 Ye, mounted on your chariot brought to Vimada the comely maid of Purumitra as a bride.<br> Ye, came unto the calling of the weakling's dame, and granted noble offspring to the happy wife.<br> 8 Ye gave a ain the vigour of his youthful life to tge sage Kali when old age was coming nigh.<br> Ye rescued Vandana and raised him from the pit, and in a moment gave Vi&#347;pal&#257; power to move.<br> 9 Ye A&#347;vins Twain, endowed with manly strength, brought forth Reblia when hidden in the cave and well-nigh dead,<br> Freed Saptavadliri, and for Atri caused the pit heated with fire to be a pleasant resting-place.<br> 10 On Pedu ye bestowed, A&#347;vins, a courser white, mighty with nine-and-ninety varied gifts of strength,<br> A horse to be renowned, who bore his friend at speed, joy-giving, Bhaga-like to be invoked of men.<br> 11 From no side, ye Two Kings whom none may check or stay, doth grief, distress, or danger come u on the man<br> Whom, A&#347;vins swift to hear, borne on your glowing path, ye with your Consort make the foremost in the race.<br> 12 Come on that Chariot which the &#7770;bhus wrought for you, the Chariot, A&#347;vins, that is speedier than thought,<br> At harnessing whereof Heaven's Daughter springs to birth, and from Vivasv&#257;n come auspicious Night and Day.<br> 13 Come, Conquerors of the sundered mountain, to our home, A&#347;vins who made the cow stream milk for &#346;ayu's sake,<br> Ye who delivered even from the wolf's deep throat and set again at liberty the swallowed quail.<br> 14 We have prepared this laud for you, O A&#347;vins, and, like the Bh&#7771;gus, as a car have framed it,<br> Have decked it as a maid to meet the bridegroom, and brought it as a son, our stay for ever.</p>
