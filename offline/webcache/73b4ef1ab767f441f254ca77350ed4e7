<p>1 They who stand round him as he moves harness the bright, the ruddy Steed<br> The lights are shining in the sky.<br> 2 On both sides to the car they yoke the two bay coursers dear to him,<br> Bold, tawny, bearers of the Chief.<br> 3 Thou, making light where no light was, and form, O men: where form was not,<br> Wast born together with the Dawns.<br> 4 Thereafter they, as is their wont, threw off the state of babes unborn,<br> Assuming sacrificial names.<br> 5 Thou, Indra, with the Tempest-Gods, the breakers down of what is firm,<br> Foundest the kine even in the cave.<br> 6 Worshipping even as they list, singers laud him who findeth wealth,<br> The far-renowned, the mighty One.<br> 7 Mayest thou verily be seen coming by fearless Indra's side:<br> Both joyous, equal in your sheen.<br> 8 With Indra's well beloved hosts, the blameless, hastening to heaven,<br> The sacrificer cries aloud.<br> 9 Come from this place, O Wanderer, or downward from the light of heaven:<br> Our songs of praise all yearn for this.<br> 10 Indra we seek to give us help, from here, from heaven above the earth,<br> Or from the spacious firmament.</p>
