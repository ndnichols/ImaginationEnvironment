<p>1. THE sacrifice drawn out with threads on every side, stretched by a hundred sacred ministers and one,&#151;<br> This do these Fathers weave who hitherward are come: they sit beside the warp and cry, Weave forth, weave back.<br> 2 The Man extends it and the Man unbinds it: even to this vault of heaven hath he outspun, it.<br> These pegs are fastened to the seat of worship: they made the S&#257;ma-hymns their weaving shuttles.<br> 3 What were the rule, the order and the model? What were the wooden fender and the butter?<br> What were the hymn, the chant, the recitation, when to the God all Deities paid worship?<br> 4 Closely was G&#257;yatr&#299; conjoined with Agni, and closely Savitar combined with Usnih.<br> Brilliant with Ukthas, Soma joined Anustup: B&#7771;haspati's voice by Brhati was aided.<br> 5 Vir&#257;j adhered to Varu&#7751;a and Mitra: here Tri&#7779;&#7789;up day by day was Indra's portion.<br> Jagat&#299; entered all the Gods together: so by this knowledge men were raised to &#7770;&#7779;is.<br> 6 So by this knowledge men were raised to &#7770;&#7779;is, when ancient sacrifice sprang up, our Fathers.<br> With the mind's eye I think that I behold them who first performed this sacrificial worship.<br> 7 They who were versed in ritual and metre, in hymns and rules, were the Seven Godlike &#7770;&#7779;is.<br> Viewing the path of those of old, the sages have taken up the reins like chariot-drivers.</p>
