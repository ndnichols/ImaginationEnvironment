<p>1. WHOMSO ye rescue here and there, whomso ye guide, O Deities,<br> To him give shelter, Agni, Mitra, Varu&#7751;a, ye Maruts, and thou Aryaman.<br> 2 Through your kind favour, Gods, on some auspicious day, the worshipper subdues his foes.<br> That man increases home and strengthening ample food who brings you offerings as ye list.<br> 3 Vasi&#7779;&#7789;ha will not overlook the lowliest one among you all.<br> O Maruts, of our Soma juice effused to-day drink all of you with eager haste.<br> 4 Your succour in the battle injures not the man to whom ye, Heroes, grant your gifts.<br> May your most recent favour turn to us again. Come quickly, ye who fain would drink.<br> 5 Come hitherward to drink the juice, O ye whose bounties give you joy.<br> These offerings are for you, these, Maruts, I present. Go not to any place but this.<br> 6 Sit on our sacred grass, be graciously inclined to give the wealth for which we long,<br> To take delight, ye Maruts, Friends of all, with Sv&#257;h&#257;, in sweet Soma juice.<br> 7 Decking the beauty of their forms in secret the Swans with purple backs have flown down hither.<br> Around me all the Company hath settled, like joyous Heroes glad in our libation.<br> 8 Maruts, the man whose wrath is hard to master, he who would slay us ere we think, O Vasus,<br> May he be tangled in the toils of mischief; smite ye him down with your most flaming weapon.<br> 9 O Maruts, ye consuming Gods, enjoy this offering brought for you,<br> To help us, ye who slay the foe.<br> 10 Sharers of household sacrifice, come, Maruts, stay not far away,<br> That ye may help us, Bounteous Ones.<br> 11 Here, Self-strong Maruts, yea, even here. ye Sages with your sunbright skins<br> I dedicate your sacrifice.<br> 12 Tryambaka we worship, sweet augmenter of prosperity.<br> As from its stem the cucumber, so may I be released from death, not reft of immortality.</p>
