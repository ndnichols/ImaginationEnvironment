hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, 
unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto  
thy seed will I give it:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the      
Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the 
Jebusite:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Unto 
a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee;  
for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the people heard   
these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>For YHVH had said 
unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I     
will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore    
now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And the children  
of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses took the     
tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called 
it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one      
which sought YHVH went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was   
without the camp.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that all the   
people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses,   
until he was gone into the tabernacle.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the           
tabernacle, and talked with Moses.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10>

tent door.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And YHVH spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And  
he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young  
man, departed not out of the tabernacle.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send     
with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found      
grace in my sight.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, show me  
now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and      
consider that this nation is thy people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

us not up hence.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found      
grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be        
separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the  
earth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And
