But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded the wall, he was 
wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And he spake before his brethren    
and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify 
themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they      
revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Now Tobiah the         
Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox go up,   
he shall even break down their stone wall.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Hear, O our ELOHIYM; for we are despised: and     
turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land   
of captivity:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before  
thee: for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>So built we the wall; and   
all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a    
mind to work.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P> 
But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the 
Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up,  
and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And conspired all of   
them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Nevertheless we made   
our prayer unto our ELOHIYM, and set a watch against them day and night,        
because of them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and   
there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And our adversaries said, 
They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and     
slay them, and cause the work to cease.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, that when the Jews which   
dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye      
shall return unto us they will be upon you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore set I in the lower places behind the  
wall, and on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with 
their swords, their spears, and their bows.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the    
nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of   
them: remember the ADONAY, which is great and terrible, and fight for your      
brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, 
when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and ELOHIYM had brought their 
counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his   
work.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And it 
came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my servants wrought in the  
work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the     
bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>They which      
builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded, every   
one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a   
weapon.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>For  
the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded. And   
he that sounded the trumpet was by me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers,  
and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are          
separated upon the wall, one far from another.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>In what place therefore ye hear the sound of 
the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us: our ELOHIYM shall fight for us.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>So we laboured in    
the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till  
the stars appeared.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his 
servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us,    
and labour on the day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the  
guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving that every one  
put them off for washing.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright
