<p>1. I LAUD your Mighty One who joyeth in the juice, him who is shared by all men, who created all;<br> Indra, whose conquering strength is powerful in war, whose fame and manly vigour Heaven and Earth revere.<br> 2 He with his friend is active, lauded, good to man, Indra who must be glorified by one like me.<br> Hero, Lord of the brave, all cars are thy delight, warring with V&#7771;tra, or for waters, or for spoil.<br> 3 Who are the men whom thou wilt further, Indra, who strive to win thy bliss allied with riches?<br> Who urged thee forward to exert thy power divine, to valour, in the war for waters on their fields?<br> 4 Thou, Indra, through the holy prayer art mighty, worthy of sacrifice at all libations.<br> In every fight thou castest heroes on the ground: thou art the noblest song, O Lord of all the folk.<br> 5 Help now, as Highest, those who toil at sacrifice: well do the people know thy great protecting might.<br> Thou shalt be Everlasing, Giver of success yea, on all these libations thou bestowest strength.<br> 6 All these libations thou makest effectual, of which thou art thyself supporter, Son of Power.<br> Therefore thy vessel is to be esteemed the best, sacrifice, holy text, prayer, and exalted speech.<br> 7 They who with flowing Soma pray to thee, O Sage, to pour on them thy gifts of opulence and wealth,<br> May they come forward, through their spirit, on the path of bliss, in the wild joy of Soma juice effused.</p>
