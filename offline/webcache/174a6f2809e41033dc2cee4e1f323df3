1</H4></TD><TD><P>We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the  
weak, and not to please ourselves.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2>  
<H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to  
edification.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>  
For even MASHIYACH pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches   
of them that reproached thee fell on me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>For whatsoever things were written aforetime were 
written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the           
scriptures might have hope.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>     
5</H4></TD><TD><P>Now the ELOHIYM of patience and consolation grant you to be   
likeminded one toward another according to MASHIYACH YAHSHUA:</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>That ye may with one mind and   
one mouth glorify ELOHIYM, even the Father of our ADONAY YAHSHUA MASHIYACH.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore receive 
ye one another, as MASHIYACH also received us to the glory of ELOHIYM.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Now I say that YAHSHUA 
MASHIYACH was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of ELOHIYM, to       
confirm the promises made unto the fathers:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And that the Gentiles might glorify ELOHIYM for   
his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the    
Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10>  
<H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his       
people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
again, Praise YHVH, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And again, Esaias saith,  
There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the        
Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Now the ELOHIYM of hope fill you with all joy   
and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the    
Holy Ghost.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of    
goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Nevertheless,        
brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you  
in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of ELOHIYM,</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>That I should be the minister 
of YAHSHUA MASHIYACH to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of ELOHIYM, that   
the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the    
Holy Ghost.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P> 
I have therefore whereof I may glory through YAHSHUA MASHIYACH in those things  
which pertain to ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>      
18</H4></TD><TD><P>For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which    
MASHIYACH hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and    
deed,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>       
Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of EL; so that     
from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the       
gospel of MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where MASHIYACH    
was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation:</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>But as it is written, To whom 
he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall        
understand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P> 
For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>But now having no more    
place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto   
you;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>        
Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see 
you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I   
be somewhat filled with your company.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto    
the saints.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P> 
For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution 
for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors  
they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual       
things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>When therefore I have     
performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into     
Spain.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And I 
am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing 
of the gospel of MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>    
30</H4></TD><TD><P>Now I beseech you, brethren, for the ADONAY YAHSHUA          
MASHIYACH's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with  
me in your prayers to ELOHIYM for me;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>That I may be delivered from them that do not   
believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be        
accepted of the saints;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>That I may come unto you with joy by the will of ELOHIYM, and may   
with you be refreshed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>Now the ELOHIYM of peace be with you all. Amen.</P></TD></TR>
