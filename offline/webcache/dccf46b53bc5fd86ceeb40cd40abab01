two baskets of figs were set before the temple of YHVH, after that              
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of     
Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and      
smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

like the figs that are first ripe: and the other basket had very naughty figs,  
which could not be eaten, they were so bad.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said YHVH unto me, What seest thou,          
Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil,  
that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

the ELOHIYM of Israel; Like these good figs, so will I acknowledge them that    
are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the  
land of the Chaldeans for their good.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that 
remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt:</P></TD></TR><TR>
