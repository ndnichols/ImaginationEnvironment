<p>1. Him who with might hath propped earth's ends, who sitteth in threefold seat, B&#7771;haspati, with thunder,<br> Him of the pleasant tongue have ancient sages, deep-thinking, holy singers, set before them.<br> 2 Wild in their course, in well-marked wise rejoicing were they, B&#7771;haspati, who pressed around us.<br> Preserve B&#7771;haspati, the stall uninjured, this company's raining, ever-moving birthplace.<br> 3 B&#7771;haspati, from thy remotest distance have they sat down who love the law eternal.<br> For thee were dug wells springing from the mountain, which murmuring round about pour streams of sweetness.<br> 4 B&#7771;haspati, when first he had his being from mighty splendour in supremest heaven,<br> Strong, with his sevenfold mouth, with noise of thunder, with his seven rays, blew and dispersed the darkness.<br> 5 With the loud-shouting band who sang his praises, with thunder, he destroyed obstructive Vala.<br> B&#7771;haspati thundering drave forth the cattle, the lowing cows who make oblations ready.<br> 6 Serve we with sacrifices, gifts, and homage even thus the Steer of all the Gods, the Father.<br> B&#7771;haspati, may we be lords of riches, with noble progeny and store of heroes.<br> 7 Surely that King by power and might heroic hath made him lord of all his foes' posses-ions,<br> Who cherishes B&#7771;haspati well-tended, adorns and worships him as foremost sharer.<br> 8 In his own house he dwells in peace and comfort: to him for ever holy food flows richly.<br> To him the people with free will pay homage-the King with whom the Brahman hath precedence.<br> 9 He, unopposed, is master of the riches of his own subjects and of hostile people.<br> The Gods uphold that King with their protection who helps the Brahman when he seeks his favour.<br> 10 Indra, B&#7771;haspati, rainers of treasure, rejoicing at this sacrifice drink the Soma.<br> Let the abundant drops sink deep within you: vouchsafe us riches with full store of heroes.<br> 11 B&#7771;haspati and Indra, make us prosper may this be your benevolence to us-ward.<br> Assist our holy thoughts, wake up our spirit: weaken the hatred of our foe and rivals.</p>
