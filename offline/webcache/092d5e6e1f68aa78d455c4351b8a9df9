<TD><P>In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of

<H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign, and     
reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem, and did not that which was right in the     
sight of YHVH his ELOHIYM, like David his father.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>But he walked in the way of the     
kings of Israel, yea, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to   
the abominations of the heathen, whom YHVH cast out from before the children of 
Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And he 
sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under    
every green tree.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD>
<P>Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to 
Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>At that time Rezin     
king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drave the Jews from Elath: and the  
Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt there unto this day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>So Ahaz sent messengers to          
Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, saying, I am thy servant and thy son: come up,  
and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the    
king of Israel, which rise up against me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found  
in the house of YHVH, and in the treasures of the king's house, and sent it for 
a present to the king of Assyria.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9>   
<H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king  
of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it  
captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>
10</H4></TD><TD><P>And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king   
of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to Urijah 
the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all    
the workmanship thereof.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king     
Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made it against king Ahaz     
came from Damascus.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar: and    
the king approached to the altar, and offered thereon.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And he burnt his burnt offering   
and his meat offering, and poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood   
of his peace offerings, upon the altar.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And he brought also the brazen altar, which was 
before YHVH, from the forefront of the house, from between the altar and the    
house of YHVH, and put it on the north side of the altar.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And king Ahaz commanded Urijah    
the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and   
the evening meat offering, and the king's burnt sacrifice, and his meat         
offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meat 
offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the  
burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and the brazen altar shall  
be for me to enquire by.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz         
commanded.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off  
them; and took down the sea from off the brazen oxen that were under it, and    
put it upon the pavement of stones.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18>
<H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in    
the house, and the king's entry without, turned he from the house of YHVH for   
the king of Assyria.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written 
in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And Ahaz slept with his fathers,  
and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son      
reigned in his stead.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000
