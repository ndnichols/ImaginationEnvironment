was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and   
upright, and one that feared ELOHIYM, and eschewed evil.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And there were born unto him seven  
sons and three daughters.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand     
camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very   
great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the        
east.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And his  
sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called   
for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And it was so, when the days of     
their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up  
early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of    
them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed ELOHIYM  
in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Now there was a day when the sons of ELOHIYM came 
to present themselves before YHVH, and Satan came also among them.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH said unto Satan,   
Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered YHVH, and said, From going to and fro   
in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH said unto Satan, Hast thou 
considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect  
and an upright man, one that feareth ELOHIYM, and escheweth evil?</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Satan answered YHVH,   
and said, Doth Job fear ELOHIYM for nought?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and      
about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed    
the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>But put forth thine hand  
now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH said unto   
Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not      
forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of YHVH.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And there was a day when  
his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest        
brother's house:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing,    
and the asses feeding beside them:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15> 
<H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, 
they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped  
alone to tell thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD>
<TD><P>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire   
of ELOHIYM is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the         
servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>While he was yet     
speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three       
bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the 
servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell        
thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>While  
he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy        
daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And, behold,    
there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the  
house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped 
alone to tell thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down  
upon the ground, and worshipped,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21>   
<H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and      
naked shall I return thither: YHVH gave, and YHVH hath taken away; blessed be   
the name of YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>In all this Job sinned not, nor charged ELOHIYM foolishly.</P></TD></TR>
