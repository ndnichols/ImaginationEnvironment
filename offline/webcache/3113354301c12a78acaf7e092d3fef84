<TD><P>Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes,   
which came from Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled,     
that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>For the Pharisees, and all the      
Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the   
elders.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other  
things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and  
pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5>
<H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not    
thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with      
unwashen hands?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you           
hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but     
their heart is far from me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>     
7</H4></TD><TD><P>Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines    
the commandments of men.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>For laying aside the commandment of ELOHIYM, ye hold the tradition  
of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye     
do.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And he     
said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of ELOHIYM, that ye may     
keep your own tradition.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4>
</TD><TD><P>For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso        
curseth father or mother, let him die the death:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>But ye say, If a man shall say to 
his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou  
mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And ye suffer him no more to do ought for    
his father or his mother;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>      
13</H4></TD><TD><P>Making the word of ELOHIYM of none effect through your       
tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he had      
called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of 
you, and understand:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can     
defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile    
the man.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>If  
any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he was entered into the house from the 
people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And he saith unto them, Are ye so 
without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from      
without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Because it entereth not into his  
heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all          
meats?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>For from within, out of   
the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Thefts,         
covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy,       
pride, foolishness:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD>
<TD><P>All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And from thence he arose, 
and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and     
would have no man know it: but he could not be hid.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>For a certain woman, whose young  
daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>The woman was a 
Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth 
the devil out of her daughter.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4> 
27</H4></TD><TD><P>But YAHSHUA said unto her, Let the children first be filled: 
for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the        
dogs.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
she answered and said unto him, Yes, ADONAY: yet the dogs under the table eat   
of the children's crumbs.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>      
29</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil  
is gone out of thy daughter.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>   
30</H4></TD><TD><P>And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone 
out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre    
and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of  
Decapolis.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; 
and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And he took him aside from the multitude,    
and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>And looking up to    
heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And straightway his  
ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake         
plain.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so  
much the more a great deal they published it;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And were beyond measure astonished, saying,  
He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to  
speak.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M.
