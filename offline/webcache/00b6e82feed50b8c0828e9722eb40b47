<p>1. MAY Indra come to us for our protection; here be the Hero, praised, our feast-companion.<br> May he whose powers are many, waxen mighty, cherish, like Dyaus, his own supreme dominion.<br> 2 Here magnify his great heroic exploits, most glorious One, enriching men with bounties,<br> Whose will is like a Sovran in assembly, who rules the people, Conqueror, all-surpassing.<br> 3 Hither let Indra come from earth or heaven, hither with speech from firmament or ocean;<br> With Maruts, from the realm of light to aid us, or from a distance, from the seat of Order.<br> 4 That Indra will we laud in our assemblies, him who is Lord of great and lasting riches,<br> Victor with V&#257;yu where the herds are gathered, who leads with boldness on to higher fortune.<br> 5 May the Priest, Lord of many blessings, striving,&#151;who fixing reverence on reverence, giving<br> Vent to his voice, inciteth men to worship&#151;with lauds bring Indra hither to our dwellings.<br> 6 When sitting pondering in deep devotion in Au&#347;ija's abode they ply the press-stone,<br> May he whose wrath is fierce, the mighty bearer, come as the house-lord's priest within our chambers.<br> 7 Surely the power of Bh&#257;rvara the mighty for ever helpeth to support the singer;<br> That which in Au&#347;ija's abode lies hidden, to come forth for delight and for devotion.<br> 8 When he unbars the spaces of the mountains, and quickens with his floods the water-torrents,<br> He finds in lair the buffalo and wild-ox when the wise lead him on to vigorous exploit.<br> 9 Auspicious are thy hands, thine arms well-fashioned which proffer bounty, Indra, to thy praiser.<br> What sloth is this? Why dost thou not rejoice thee? Why dost thou not delight thyself with giving?<br> 10 So Indra is the truthful Lord of treasure. Freedom he gave to man by slaying V&#7771;tra.<br> Much-lauded! help us with thy power to riches: may I be sharer of thy Godlike favour.<br> 11 Now, Indra! lauded, glorified with praises, let power swell high, like rivers, for the singer.<br> For thee a new hymn, Lord of Bays! is fashioned. May we, care-borne, through song be victors ever.</p>
