<p>1. BRING forth your gifts to his refulgent splendour, your hymn as purest offering to Agni,<br> To him who goes as messenger with knowledge between all songs of men and Gods in heaven.<br> 2 Wise must this Agni be, though young and tender, since he was born, Most Youthful, of his Mother;<br> He who with bright teeth seizeth fast the forests, and eats his food, though plenteous, in a moment.<br> 3 Before his presence must we all assemble, this God's whom men have seized in his white splendour.<br> This Agni who hath brooked that men should seize him hath shone for man with glow insufferable.<br> 4 Far-seeing hath this Agni been established, deathless mid mortals, wise among the foolish.<br> Here, O victorious God, forbear to harm us: may weforever share thy gracious favour.<br> 5 He who hath occupied his God-made dwelling, Agni, in wisdom hath surpassed Immortals.<br> A Babe unborn, the plants and trees support him, and the earth beareth him the All-sustainer.<br> 6 Agni is Lord of Am&#7771;ta. in abundance, Lord of the gift of wealth and hero valour,<br> Victorious God, let us not sit about thee like men devoid of strength, beauty, and worship.<br> 7 The foeman's treasure may be won with labour: may we be masters of our own possessions.<br> Agni, no son is he who springs from others: lengthen not out the pathways of the foolish.<br> 8 Unwelcome for adoption is the stranger, one to be thought of as another's offipring,<br> Though grown familiar by continual presence. May our strong hero come, freshly triumphant.<br> 9 Guard us from him who would assail us, Agni; preserve us O thou Victor, from dishonour.<br> Here let the place of darkening come upon thee: may wealth be ours, desirable, in thousands.<br> 10 Shine this felicity on us, O Agni: may we attain to perfect understanding.<br> All happiness be theirs who sing and praise thee. Ye Gods, preserve us evermore with blessings.</p>
