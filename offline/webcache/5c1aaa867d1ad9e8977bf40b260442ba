<p>1. WHERE Heaven and Earth combine in men's assembly, and ttose who love the Gods delight in worship,<br> Where the libations are effused for Indra, may he come first to drink and make him stronger.<br> 2 We crave the heavenly grace of Gods to guard us-so may B&#7771;haspati, O friends, exalt us-<br> That he, the Bounteous God, may find us sintess, who giveth from a distance like a father.<br> 3 That Brahma&#7751;aspati, most High and Gracious, I glorify with offerings and with homage.<br> May the great song of praise divine, reach Indra who is the King of prayer the Gods&#146; creation.<br> 4 May that B&#7771;haspati who brings all blessings, most dearly loved, be seated by our altar.<br> Heroes and wealth we crave; may he bestow them, and bear us safe beyond the men who vex us.<br> 5 To us these Deathless Ones, erst born, have granted this laud of ours which gives the Immortal pleasure.<br> Let us invoke B&#7771;haspati, the foeless, the clear-voiced God, the Holy One of households<br> 6 Him, this B&#7771;haspati, his red-hued horses, drawing together, full of strength, bring hither.<br> Robed in red colour like the cloud, they carry the Lord of Might whose friendship gives a dwelling.<br> 7 For he is pure, with hundred wings, refulgent, with sword of gold, impetuous, winning sunlight.<br> Sublime B&#7771;haspati, easy of access granteth his friends most bountiful refreshment.<br> 8 Both Heaven and Earth, divine, the Deity's Parents, have made B&#7771;haspati increase in grandeur.<br> Glorify him, O friends, who merits glory: may he give prayer fair way and easy passage.<br> 9 This, Brahma&#7751;aspati, is your laudation prayer hath been made to thunderwielding Indra.<br> Favour our songs, wake up our thought and spirit: destroy the godless and our foemen's malice.<br> 10 Ye Twain are Lords of wealth in earth and heaven, thou, O B&#7771;haspati, and thou, O Indra.<br> Mean though he be, give wealth to him who lauds you. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
