Chapter 13</H1></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And, behold, there came a man of ELOHIYM out of Judah by the word of     
YHVH unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And he cried against the    
altar in the word of YHVH, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith YHVH; Behold, a 
child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee      
shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and  
men's bones shall be burnt upon thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is  
the sign which YHVH hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes 
that are upon it shall be poured out.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the 
saying of the man of ELOHIYM, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that 
he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand,    
which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again 
to him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>The    
altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the  
sign which the man of ELOHIYM had given by the word of YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And the king answered and said  
unto the man of ELOHIYM, Entreat now the face of YHVH thy ELOHIYM, and pray for 
me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of ELOHIYM besought      
YHVH, and the king's hand was restored him again, and became as it was          
before.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
the king said unto the man of ELOHIYM, Come home with me, and refresh thyself,  
and I will give thee a reward.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>  
8</H4></TD><TD><P>And the man of ELOHIYM said unto the king, If thou wilt give  
me half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor   
drink water in this place:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4>
</TD><TD><P>For so was it charged me by the word of YHVH, saying, Eat no bread, 
nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>So he went another way,   
and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Now there dwelt an old prophet in 
Bethel; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of ELOHIYM    
had done that day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them  
they told also to their father.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>
12</H4></TD><TD><P>And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his   
sons had seen what way the man of ELOHIYM went, which came from Judah.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto his 
sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon,</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And went after  
the man of ELOHIYM, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said unto him,   
Art thou the man of ELOHIYM that camest from Judah? And he said, I am.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Then he said unto    
him, Come home with me, and eat bread.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go 
in with thee: neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this        
place:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>For   
it was said to me by the word of YHVH, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water  
there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>He said unto him, I am a prophet  
also as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of YHVH, saying, Bring 
him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But 
he lied unto him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank      
water.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of YHVH came unto the  
prophet that brought him back:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4> 
21</H4></TD><TD><P>And he cried unto the man of ELOHIYM that came from Judah,   
saying, Thus saith YHVH, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of YHVH,    
and hast not kept the commandment which YHVH thy ELOHIYM commanded thee,</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>But camest      
back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of the which did say   
to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy carcass shall not come unto the  
sepulchre of thy fathers.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>      
23</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he  
had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had 
brought back.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his       
carcass was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by    
the carcass.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>
And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcass cast in the way, and the lion   
standing by the carcass: and they came and told it in the city where the old    
prophet dwelt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he    
said, It is the man of ELOHIYM, who was disobedient unto the word of YHVH:      
therefore YHVH hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain 
him, according to the word of YHVH, which he spake unto him.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And he spake to his sons,     
saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And he went and found his carcass 
cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcass: the lion had 
not eaten the carcass, nor torn the ass.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And the prophet took up the carcass of the man  
of ELOHIYM, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet  
came to the city, to mourn and to bury him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And he laid his carcass in his own grave; and   
they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, after he had 
buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in  
the sepulchre wherein the man of ELOHIYM is buried; lay my bones beside his     
bones:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>For   
the saying which he cried by the word of YHVH against the altar in Bethel, and  
against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria,   
shall surely come to pass.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>     
33</H4></TD><TD><P>After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way,    
but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places:          
whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the    
high places.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>
And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and   
to destroy it from off the face of the earth.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This
