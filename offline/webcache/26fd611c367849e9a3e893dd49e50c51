1</H4></TD><TD><P>Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of 
a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face  
shall be changed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD>
<P>I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in regard of the     
oath of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he      
doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>  
4</H4></TD><TD><P>Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say  
unto him, What doest thou?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise  
man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Because to every purpose there is time and     
judgment, therefore the misery of man is great upon him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>For he knoweth not that which shall 
be: for who can tell him when it shall be?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>There is no man that hath power over the spirit   
to retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there is   
no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given 
to it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>All     
this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the   
sun: there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And so I saw    
the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they   
were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this is also vanity.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Because sentence     
against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons  
of men is fully set in them to do evil.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and   
his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that   
fear ELOHIYM, which fear before him:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>But it shall not be well with the wicked,       
neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth    
not before ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD>
<TD><P>There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just men,  
unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be     
wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said 
that this also is vanity.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>      
15</H4></TD><TD><P>Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing   
under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide 
with him of his labour the days of his life, which ELOHIYM giveth him under the 
sun.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>When I  
applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon    
the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his   
eyes:)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Then  
I beheld all the work of ELOHIYM, that a man cannot find out the work that is   
done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall    
not find it; yea farther; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not  
be able to find it.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by
