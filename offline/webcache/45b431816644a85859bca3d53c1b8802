</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>This is the third 
time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every     
word be established.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second    
time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to 
all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Since ye seek a proof of MASHIYACH  
speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>For though he was      
crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of ELOHIYM. For we also  
are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of ELOHIYM toward      
you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Examine   
yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your 
own selves, how that YAHSHUA MASHIYACH is in you, except ye be reprobates?</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>But I trust that  
ye shall know that we are not reprobates.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Now I pray to ELOHIYM that ye do no evil; not     
that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest,     
though we be as reprobates.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>     
8</H4></TD><TD><P>For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the          
truth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>For we  
are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, even your 
perfection.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use    
sharpness, according to the power which YHVH hath given me to edification, and  
not to destruction.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one   
mind, live in peace; and the ELOHIYM of love and peace shall be with you.</P>

<A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>The grace of the ADONAY YAHSHUA MASHIYACH,   
and the love of ELOHIYM, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all.  
Amen.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M. Hurt,
