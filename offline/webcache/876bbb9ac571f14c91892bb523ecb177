<p>1. THOUGH, Indra, thou art called by men eastward and westward, north and south,<br> Thou chiefly art with &#256;nava and Turva&#347;a, brave Champion I urged by men to Come.<br> 2 Or, Indra, when with Ruma, Ru&#347;ama, &#346;y&#257;vaka, and K&#7771;pa thou rejoicest thee,<br> Still do the Ka&#7751;vas, bringing praises, with their prayers, O Indra, draw thee hither: come.<br> 3 Even as the wild-bull, when he thirsts, goes to the desert's watery pool,<br> Come hither quickly both at morning and at eve, and with the Ka&#7751;vas drink thy fill.<br> 4 May the drops gladden thee, rich Indra, and obtain bounty for him who pours the juice.<br> Soma pressed in the mortar didst thou take and drink, and hence hast won surpassing might.<br> 5 With mightier strength he conquered strength, with energy he crushed their wrath.<br> O Indra, Strong in youth, all those who sought the fray bent and bowed down to thee like trees.<br> 6 He who wins promise of thine aid goes girt as with a thousand mighty men of war.<br> He makes his son preeminent in hero might: he serves with reverential prayer.<br> 7 With thee, the Mighty, for our Friend, we will not fear or feel fatigue.<br> May we see Turva&#347;a and Yadu: thy great deed, O Hero, must be glorified.<br> 8 On his left hip the Hero hath reclined himself: the proffered feast offends him not.<br> The milk is blended with the honey of the bee: quickly come hither, baste, and drink.<br> 9 Indra, thy friend is fair of form and rich in horses, cars, and kine.<br> He evermore hath food accompanied by wealth, and radiant joins the company.<br> 10 Come like a thirsty antelope to the drinking-place: drink Soma to thy heart's desire.<br> Raining it down, O Maghavan, day after day, thou gainest thy surpassing might.<br> 11 Priest, let the Soma juice flow forth, for Indra longs to drink thereof.<br> He even now hath yoked his vigorous Bay Steeds: the V&#7771;tra-slayer hath come near.<br> 12 The man with whom thou fillcst thee with Soma deems himself a pious worshipper.<br> This thine appropriate food is here poured out for thee: come, hasten forward. drink of it,<br> 13 Press out the Soma juice, ye priests, for Indra borne upon his car.<br> The pressing-stones speak loud of Indra, while they shed the juice which, offered, honours him.<br> 14 To the brown juice may his dear vigorous Bay Steeds bring Indra, to our holy task.<br> Hither let thy Car-steeds who seek the sacrifice bring thee to our drink-offerings.<br> 15 P&#363;&#7779;an, the Lord of ample wealth, for firm alliance we elect.<br> May he with wisdom, &#346;akra! Looser! Much-invoked! aid us to riches and to seed.<br> 16 Sharpen us like a razor in the barber's hands: send riches thou who settest free.<br> Easy to find with thee are treasures of the Dawn for mortal man whom thou dost speed.<br> 17 P&#363;&#7779;an, I long to win thy love, I long to praise thee, Radiant God.<br> Excellent Lord, &#146;tis strange tome, no wish have I to sing the psalm that Pajra sings.<br> 18 My kine, O Radiant God, seek pasture where they will, my during wealth, Immortal One.<br> Be our protector, P&#363;&#7779;an! be, most liberal Lord, propitious to our gathering strength.<br> 19 Rich was the gift Kurunga gave, a hundred steeds at morning rites.<br> Among the gifts of Turva&#347;as we thought of him, the opulent, the splendid King.<br> 20 What by his morning songs Ka&#7751;va, the powerful, hath, with the Priyamedhas, gained-<br> 71 The herds of sixty thousand pure and spotless kine, have I, the &#7770;&#7779;i, driven away.<br> 21 The very trees were joyful at my coming: kine they obtained in plenty, steeds in plenty.</p>
