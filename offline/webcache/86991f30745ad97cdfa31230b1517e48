<p>1. Agni is wakened by the people's fuel to meet the Dawn who cometh like a milch-cow.<br> Like young trees shooting up on high their branches, his flames are rising to the vault of heaven.<br> 2 For worship of the Gods the Priest was wakened: at morning gracious Agni hath arisen.<br> Kindled, his radiant might is made apparent, and the great Deity set free from darkness.<br> 3 When he hath stirred the line of his attendants, with the pure milk pure Agni is anointed.<br> The strength-bestowing gift is then made ready, which spread in front, with tongues, erect, he drinketh.<br> 4 The spirits of the pious turn together to Agni, as the eyes of all to S&#363;rya.<br> He, when both Dawns of different hues have borne him, springs up at daybreak as a strong white charger.<br> 5 The noble One was born at days' beginning, laid red in colour mid the well-laid fuel.<br> Yielding in every house his seven rich treasures, Agni is seated, Priest most skilled in worship.<br> 6 Agni hath sat him down, a Priest most skilful, on a sweet-smelling place, his Mother's bosom.<br> Young, faithful, sage, preeminent o&#146;er many, kindled among the folk whom he sustaineth.<br> 7 This Singer excellent at sacrifices, Agni the Priest, they glorify with homage.<br> Him who spread out both worlds by Law Eternal they balm with oil, strong Steed who never faileth.<br> 8. He, worshipful House-Friend, in his home is worshipped, our own auspicious guest, lauded by sages.<br> That strength the Bull with thousand horns possesses. In might, O Agni, thou excellest others.<br> 9 Thou quickly passest by all others, Agni, for him to whom thou hast appeared most lovely,<br> Wondrously fair, adorable, effulgent, the guest of men, the darling of the people.<br> 10 To thee, Most Youthful God! to thee, O Agni from near and far the people bring their tribute.<br> Mark well the prayer of him who best extols thee. Great, high, auspicious, Agni, is thy shelter.<br> 11 Ascend to-day thy splendid car, O Agni, in splendour, with the Holy Ones around it.<br> Knowing the paths by mid-air's spacious region bring hither Gods to feast on our oblation.<br> 12 To him adorable, sage, strong and mighty we have sung forth our song of praise and homage.<br> Gavisthira hath raised with prayer to Agni this laud far-reaching, like gold light to heaven.</p>
