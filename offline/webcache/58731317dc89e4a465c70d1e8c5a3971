<p>1. IN perfect unison all yearning hymns of mine that find the light of heaven have sung forth Indra's praise.<br> As wives embrace their lord, the comely bridegroom, so they compass Maghavan about that he may help.<br> 2 Directed unto thee my spirit never strays, for I have set my hopes on thee, O Much-invoked!<br> Sit, Wonderful! as King upon the sacred grass, and let thy drinking-place be by the Soma juice.<br> 3 From indigence and hunger Indra turns away: Maghavan hath dominion over precious wealth.<br> These the Seven Rivers flowing on their downward path increase the vital vigour of the potent Steer.<br> 4 As on the fair-leafed tree rest birds, to Indra flow the gladdening Soma juices that the bowls contain.<br> Their face that glows with splendour through their mighty power hath found the shine of heaven for man, the &#256;ryas' light.<br> 5 As in the game a gambler piles his winnings, so Maghavan, sweeping all together, gained the Sun<br> This mighty deed of thine none other could achieve, none, Maghavan, before thee, none in recent time.<br> 6 Maghavan came by turns to all the tribes of men: the Steer took notice of the people's songs of praise.<br> The man in whose libations &#346;akra hath delight by means of potent Somas vanquisheth his foes.<br> 7 When Soma streams together unto Indra flow like waters to the river, rivulets to the lake,<br> In place of sacrifice sages exalt his might, as the rain swells the corn by moisture sent from heaven.<br> 8 He rushes through the region like a furious Bull, he who hath made these floods the dames of worthy lords.<br> This Maghavan hath found light for the man who brings oblation, sheds the juice, and promptly pours his gifts.<br> 9 Let the keen axe come forth together with the light: here be,.as erst, the teeming cow of sacrifice.<br> Let the Red God shine bright with his refulgent ray, and let the Lord of heroes glow like heaven's clear sheen.<br> 10 O Much-invoked, may we subdue all famine and evil want with store of grain and cattle.<br> May we allied, as first in rank, with princes obtain possessions by our own exertion.<br> 11 B&#7771;haspati protect us from the rearward, and from above, and from below, from sinners.<br> May Indra from the front, and from the centre, as Friend to friends, vouchsafe us room and freedom.</p>
