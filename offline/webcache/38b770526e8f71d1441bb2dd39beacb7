1</H4></TD><TD><P>O ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of   
the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of     
fire in Bethhaccerem: for evil appeareth out of the north, and great            
destruction.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>I 
have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>The shepherds with their    
flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch their tents against her round      
about; they shall feed every one in his place.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us  
go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the      
evening are stretched out.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>For thus hath     
YHVH of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast a mount against Jerusalem: this 
is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>As a fountain     
casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness: violence and spoil   
is heard in her; before me continually is grief and wounds.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Be thou instructed, O           
Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not 
inhabited.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Thus saith YHVH of hosts, They shall throughly glean the remnant of Israel as a 
vine: turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the baskets.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>To whom shall I speak,    
and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and   
they cannot hearken: behold, the word of YHVH is unto them a reproach; they     
have no delight in it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>Therefore I am full of the fury of YHVH; I am weary with holding    
in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the assembly of young 
men together: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with  
him that is full of days.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>      
12</H4></TD><TD><P>And their houses shall be turned unto others, with their     
fields and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants  
of the land, saith YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4>
</TD><TD><P>For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one 
is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one   
dealeth falsely.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly,    
saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Were they ashamed when they had committed    
abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush:       
therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time that I visit them   
they shall be cast down, saith YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus saith YHVH, Stand ye in the ways, and see, 
and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye      
shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk therein.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Also I set      
watchmen over you, saying, Hearken to the sound of the trumpet. But they said,  
We will not hearken.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is among 
them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Hear,  
O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their    
thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but     
rejected it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>
To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from  
a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices     
sweet unto me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>Therefore thus saith YHVH, Behold, I will lay stumblingblocks before this    
people, and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them; the         
neighbour and his friend shall perish.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

the north country, and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the     
earth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>They  
shall lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice 
roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, set in array as men for war    
against thee, O daughter of Zion.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24>  
<H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble:    
anguish hath taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in travail.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Go not forth into the     
field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy and fear is on every     
side.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>O      
daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes:   
make thee mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation: for the        
spoiler shall suddenly come upon us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

among my people, that thou mayest know and try their way.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>They are all grievous revolters,
