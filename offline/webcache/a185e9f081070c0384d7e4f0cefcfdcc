<p>1 NE&#146;ER is he injured whom the Gods Varu&#7751;a, Mitra, Aryaman,<br> The excellently wise, protect.<br> 2 He prospers ever, free from scathe, whom they, as with full hands, enrich,<br> Whom they preserve from every foe.<br> 3 The Kings drive far away from him his troubles and his enemies,<br> And lead him safely o&#146;er distress.<br> 4 Thornless, &#256;dityas, is the path, easy for him who seeks the Law:<br> With him is naught to anger you.<br> 5 What sacrifice, &#256;dityas, ye Heroes guide by the path direct,&#151;<br> May that come nigh unto your thought.<br> 6 That mortal, ever unsubdued, gains wealth and every precious thing,<br> And children also of his own.<br> 7 How, my friends, shall we prepare Aryaman's and Mitra's laud,<br> Glorious food of Varu&#7751;a?<br> 8 I point not out to you a man who strikes the pious, or reviles:<br> Only with hymns I call you nigh.<br> 9 Let him not love to speak ill words: but fear the One who holds all four<br> Within his hand, until they fall.</p>
