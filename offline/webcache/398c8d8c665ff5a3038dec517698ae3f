VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>If there be therefore any           
consolation in MASHIYACH, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the      
Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2>  
<H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same  
love, being of one accord, of one mind.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory;  
but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Look not every man on  
his own things, but every man also on the things of others.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Let this mind be in you, which  
was also in MASHIYACH YAHSHUA:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>  
6</H4></TD><TD><P>Who, being in the form of ELOHIYM, thought it not robbery to  
be equal with EL:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD>
<P>But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant,  
and was made in the likeness of men:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8>
<H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself,  
and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore ELOHIYM also hath     
highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>That at the name of  
YAHSHUA every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and    
things under the earth;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And that every tongue should confess that YAHSHUA MASHIYACH is      
ADONAY, to the glory of ELOHIYM the Father.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always        
obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out   
your own salvation with fear and trembling.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>For it is ELOHIYM which worketh in you both to  
will and to do of his good pleasure.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Do all things without murmurings and            
disputings:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P> 
That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of ELOHIYM, without rebuke, in  
the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in    
the world;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of MASHIYACH,     
that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Yea, and if I be offered upon the 
sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>For the same cause   
also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>But I trust in the ADONAY YAHSHUA to send       
Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know     
your state.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P> 
For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>For all seek their   
own, not the things which are YAHSHUA MASHIYACH's.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>But ye know the proof of him,     
that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Him therefore I hope 
to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>But I trust in the ADONAY 
that I also myself shall come shortly.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you      
Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your  
messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>For he longed after you all, and was full of 
heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>For indeed he was sick nigh   
unto death: but ELOHIYM had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also,  
lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>I sent him therefore the more carefully, that,  
when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Receive him     
therefore in the ADONAY with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>Because for the work 
of MASHIYACH he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your     
lack of service toward me.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright
