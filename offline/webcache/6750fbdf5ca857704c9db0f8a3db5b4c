<p>1. WHERE hath the hymn with reverence, like an envoy, found both fair Gods to-day, invoked of many-<br> Hymn that hath brought the two N&#257;satyas hither? To this man's thought be ye, both Gods, most friendly.<br> 2 Come readily to this mine invocation, lauded with songs, that ye may drink the juices.<br> Compass this house to keep it from the foeman, that none may force it, either near or distant.<br> 3 Juice in wide room hath been prepared to feast you: for you the grass is strewn, most soft to tread on.<br> With lifted hands your servant hath adored you. Yearningfor you the press-stones shed the liquid.<br> 4 Agni uplifts him at your sacrifices: forth goes the oblation dropping oil and glowing.<br> Up stands the grateful-minded priest, elected, appointed to invoke the two N&#257;satyas.<br> 5 Lords of great wealth! for glory, S&#363;rya's Daughter mounted your car that brings a hundred succours.<br> Famed for your magic arts were ye, magicians! amid the race of Gods, ye dancing Heroes!<br> 6 Ye Twain, with these your glories fair to look on, brought, to win victory, rich gifts for S&#363;rya.<br> After you flew your birds, marvels of beauty: dear to our hearts! the song, well lauded, reached you.<br> 7 May your winged coursers, best to draw. N&#257;satyas! convey you to the object of your wishes.<br> Swift as the thought, your car hath been sent onward to food of many a sort and dainty viands.<br> 8 Lords of great wealth, manifold is your bounty: ye filled our cow with food that never faileth.<br> Lovers of sweetness! yours are praise and singers, and poured libations which have sought your favour.<br> 9 Mine were two mares of Puraya, brown, swift-footed; a hundred with Sumidha, food with Peruk<br> Sanda gave ten gold-decked and well-trained horses, tame and obedient and of lofty stature.<br> 10 N&#257;satyas! Purupanthas offered hundreds, thousands of steeds to him who sang your praises,<br> Gave, Heroes! to the singer Bharadv&#257;ja. Ye-Wonder-Workers, let the fiends be slaughtered.<br> 11 May I with princes share your bliss in freedom.</p>
