<p>1. THE Dak&#7779;i&#7751;&#257;'s broad chariot hath been harnessed: this car the Gods Immortal have ascended.<br> Fain to bring light to homes of men the noble and active Goddess hath emerged from darkness.<br> 2 She before all the living world hath wakened, the Lofty One who wins and gathers treasure.<br> Revived and ever young on high she glances. Dawn hath come first unto our morning worship.<br> 3 If, Dawn, thou Goddess nobly born, thou dealest fortune this day to all the race of mortals,<br> May Savitar the God, Friend of the homestead, declare before the Sun that we are sinless.<br> 4 Showing her wonted form each day that passeth, spreading the light she visiteth each dwelling.<br> Eager for conquest, with bright sheen she cometh. Her portion is the best of goodly treasures.<br> 5 Sister of Varu&#7751;a, sister of Bhaga, first among all sing forth, O joyous Morning.<br> Weak be the strength of him who worketh evil: may we subdue him with our car the guerdon.<br> 6 Let our glad hymns and holy thoughts rise upward, for the flames brightly burning have ascended.<br> The far-refulgent Mornings make apparent the lovely treasures which the darkness covered.<br> 7 The one departeth and the other cometh: unlike in hue day's, halves march on successive.<br> One hides the gloom of the surrounding Parents. Dawn on her shining chariot is resplendent.<br> 8 The same in form to-day, the same tomorrow, they still keep Varu&#7751;a's eternal statute.<br> Blameless, in turn they traverse thirty regions, and dart across the spirit in a moment.<br> 9 She who hath knowledge Of the first day's nature is born refulgent white from out the darkness.<br> The Maiden breaketh not the law of Order, day by day coming to the place appointed.<br> 10 In pride of beauty like a maid thou goest, O Goddess, to the God who longs to win thee,<br> And smiling youthful, as thou shinest brightly, before him thou discoverest thy bosom.<br> 11 Fair as a bride embellished by her mother thou showest forth thy form that all may see it.<br> Blessed art thou O Dawn. Shine yet more widely. No other Dawns have reached what thou attainest.<br> 12 Rich in kine, horses, and all goodly treasures, in constant operation with the sunbeams,<br> The Dawns depart and come again assuming their wonted forms that promise happy fortune.<br> 13 Obedient to the rein of Law Eternal give us each thought that more and more shall bless us.<br> Shine thou on us to-day, Dawn, swift to listen. With us be riches and with chiefs who worship.</p>
