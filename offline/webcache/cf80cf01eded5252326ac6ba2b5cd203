it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened.</P></TD>

enter by the way of the porch of that gate without, and shall stand by the post 
of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace     
offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go  
forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the       
gate.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou

</TD><TD><P>After he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the 
gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward the north:     
and, behold, there was a place on the two sides westward.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

where they shall bake the meat offering; that they bear them not out into the   
utter court, to sanctify the people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad: these four corners were of 
one measure.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>
And there was a row of building round about in them, round about them four, and 
it was made with boiling places under the rows round about.</P></TD></TR><TR>

the sacrifice of the people.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
