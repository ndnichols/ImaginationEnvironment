<p>1. LIGHTLY your coursers travel through the regions when round the sea of air your car is flying.<br> Your golden fellies scatter drops of moisture: drinking the sweetness ye <A HREF="errata.htm#7">attend</A> the Mornings.<br> 2 Ye as ye travel overtake the Courser who flies apart, the Friend of man, most holy.<br> The prayer is that the Sister may convey you, all praised, meath-drinkers! to support and strengthen.<br> 3 Ye have deposited, matured within her, in the raw cow the first milk of the milch-cow,<br> Which the bright offerer, shining like a serpent mid trees, presents to you whose form is perfect.<br> 4 Ye made the fierce heat to be full of sweetness for Atri at his wish, like streaming water.<br> Fire-offering thence is yours, O A&#347;vins, Heroes: your car-wheels speed to us like springs of honey.<br> 5 Like Tugra's ancient son may I, ye Mighty, bring you to give your gifts with milk-oblations.<br> Your greatness compasseth Earth, Heaven, and Waters: decayed for you is sorrow's net, ye Holy.<br> 6 When, Bounteous Ones, ye drive your yoked team downward, ye send, by your own natures, understanding.<br> Swift as the wind let the prince please and feast you: he, like a pious man, gains strength for increase.<br> 7 For verily we truthful singers praise you the niggard trafficker is here excluded.<br> Now, even now do ye O blameless A&#347;vins, ye Mighty, guard the man whose God is near him.<br> 8 You of a truth day after day, O A&#347;vins, that he might win the very plenteous torrent,<br> Agastya, famous among mortal heroes, roused with a thousand lauds like sounds of music.<br> 9 When with the glory of your car ye travel, when we go speeding like the priest of mortals,<br> And give good horses to sacrificers, may we, N&#257;satyas! gain our share of riches.<br> 10 With songs of praise we call to-day, O A&#347;vins, that your new chariot, for our own well-being,<br> That circles heaven with never-injured fellies. May we find strengthening food in full abundance.</p>
