</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>Again there was a 
day when the sons of ELOHIYM came to present themselves before YHVH, and Satan  
came also among them to present himself before YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH said unto Satan, From      
whence comest thou? And Satan answered YHVH, and said, From going to and fro in 
the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH said unto Satan, Hast thou considered 
my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an      
upright man, one that feareth ELOHIYM, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth 
fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him        
without cause.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>
And Satan answered YHVH, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will 
he give for his life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD>
<TD><P>But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he   
will curse thee to thy face.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>    
6</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but    
save his life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>
So went Satan forth from the presence of YHVH, and smote Job with sore boils    
from the sole of his foot unto his crown.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself      
withal; and he sat down among the ashes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still      
retain thine integrity? curse ELOHIYM, and die.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one   
of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of       
ELOHIYM, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his    
lips.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Now    
when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they    
came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the         
Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together   
to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, 
and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one 
his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>So they sat down with him     
upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him:    
for they saw that his grief was very great.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This
