were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>To whom the word of YHVH came in the days of      
Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>It came also in   
the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the end of the      
eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the carrying    
away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the word of YHVH came unto me, saying,</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Before I formed   
thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I   
sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said I, Ah, ADONAY     
YHVH! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>But YHVH said unto me, Say not, I am a child:  
for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee  
thou shalt speak.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD>
<P>Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith      
YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Then     
YHVH put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And YHVH said unto me, Behold, I 
have put my words in thy mouth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>
10</H4></TD><TD><P>See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the  
kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to  
build, and to plant.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Moreover the word of YHVH came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what      
seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And the word of YHVH came unto me 
the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; and 
the face thereof is toward the north.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>For, lo, I will call all the  
families of the kingdoms of the north, saith YHVH; and they shall come, and     
they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem,  
and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of    
Judah.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And I 
will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have    
forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works  
of their own hands.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all     
that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee       
before them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>
For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and 
brasen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the    
princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the     
land.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I   
am with thee, saith YHVH, to deliver thee.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This
