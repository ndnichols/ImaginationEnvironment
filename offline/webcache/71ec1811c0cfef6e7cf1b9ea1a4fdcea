Chapter 3</H1></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any  
obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of 
the wives;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>    
While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Whose adorning let it not be    
that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of       
putting on of apparel;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not     
corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the      
sight of ELOHIYM of great price.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>
5</H4></TD><TD><P>For after this manner in the old time the holy women also,    
who trusted in ELOHIYM, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own  
husbands:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Even 
as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye 
do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them         
according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, 
and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not      
hindered.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>     
Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as       
brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9> 
<H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but  
contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should     
inherit a blessing.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD>
<TD><P>For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his       
tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Let him eschew evil, and do good; 
let him seek peace, and ensue it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12>  
<H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>For the eyes of YHVH are over the righteous, and his     
ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of YHVH is against them that do  
evil.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>But and if ye suffer 
for righteousness' sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror,       
neither be troubled;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>But sanctify YHVH in your hearts: and be ready always to give an    
answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with    
meekness and fear:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of    
evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in    
MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>  
For it is better, if the will of ELOHIYM be so, that ye suffer for well doing,  
than for evil doing.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>For MASHIYACH also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the    
unjust, that he might bring us to ELOHIYM, being put to death in the flesh, but 
quickened by the Spirit:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4>
</TD><TD><P>By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Which sometime  
were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of ELOHIYM waited in the days of  
Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were     
saved by water.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD>
<P>The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the        
putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience     
toward ELOHIYM,) by the resurrection of YAHSHUA MASHIYACH:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Who is gone into heaven, and is   
on the right hand of ELOHIYM; angels and authorities and powers being made      
subject unto him.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by
