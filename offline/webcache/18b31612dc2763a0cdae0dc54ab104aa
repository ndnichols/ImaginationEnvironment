1</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA went out, and departed from the temple: and his   
disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA said unto them, 
See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left     
here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And as he sat upon the mount of 
Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall      
these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of    
the world?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
YAHSHUA answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>For many shall come in 
my name, saying, I am MASHIYACH; and shall deceive many.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And ye shall hear of wars and       
rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to 
pass, but the end is not yet.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>   
7</H4></TD><TD><P>For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against     
kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in       
divers places.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>
All these are the beginning of sorrows.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And then shall  
many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And many false  
prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

many shall wax cold.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And this gospel 
of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all        
nations; and then shall the end come.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>When ye therefore shall see the abomination of  
desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso    
readeth, let him understand:)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>  
16</H4></TD><TD><P>Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Let him which   
is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Neither let him      
which is in the field return back to take his clothes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And woe unto them that are with   
child, and to them that give suck in those days!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>But pray ye that your flight be   
not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>For then shall be great tribulation, such as 
was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall       
be.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And      
except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for  
the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here 
is MASHIYACH, or there; believe it not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>For there shall arise false MASHIYACHs, and     
false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it    
were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Behold, I have told you           
before.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>     
Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not       
forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>For as the lightning cometh   
out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of    
the Son of man be.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered        
together.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and  
the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and    
the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And then shall appear the sign of the Son of    
man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall 
see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great          
glory.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather 
together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>Now learn a     
parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth       
leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

things, know that it is near, even at the doors.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>Verily I say unto you, This       
generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>Heaven and earth shall pass   
away, but my words shall not pass away.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no,    
not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>But as the days of Noe were, so shall also   
the coming of the Son of man be.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38>   
<H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>For as in the days that were before the flood they were  
eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe    
entered into the ark,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall 
also the coming of the Son of man be.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>Then shall two be in the field; the one shall   
be taken, and the other left.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>  
41</H4></TD><TD><P>Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be    
taken, and the other left.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>     
42</H4></TD><TD><P>Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your ADONAY doth  
come.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>But    
know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief   
would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be  
broken up.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man  
cometh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P>Who  
then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his     
household, to give them meat in due season?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

cometh shall find so doing.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>    
47</H4></TD><TD><P>Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all 
his goods.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V48><H4>48</H4></TD><TD><P>  
But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his       
coming;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V49><H4>49</H4></TD><TD><P>And

hour that he is not aware of,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V51><H4>  
51</H4></TD><TD><P>And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with  
the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</P></TD></TR>
