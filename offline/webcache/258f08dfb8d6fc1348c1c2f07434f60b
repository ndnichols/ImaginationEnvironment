<p>1. COME, radiant A&#347;vins, with your noble horses: accept your servant's hymns, ye Wonder-Workers:<br> Enjoy oblations which we bring to greet you.<br> 2 The gladdening juices stand prepared before you: come quickly and partake of mine oblation.<br> Pass by the calling of our foe and bear us.<br> 3 Your chariot with a hundred aids, O A&#347;vins, beareth you swift as thought across the regions,<br> Speeding to us, O ye whose wealth is S&#363;rya.<br> 4 What time this stone of yours, the Gods&#146; adorer, upraised, sounds forth for you as Soma-presser,<br> Let the priest bring you, Fair Ones, through oblations.<br> 5 The nourishment ye have is, truly, wondrous: ye gave thereof a quickening store to Atri,<br> Who being dear to you, receives your favour.<br> 6 That gift, which all may gain, ye gave Cyav&#257;na, when he grew old, who offered you oblations,<br> When ye bestowed on him enduring beauty.<br> 7 What time his wicked friends abandoned Bhujyu, O A&#347;vins, in the middle of the ocean,<br> Your horse delivered him, your faithful servant.<br> 8 Ye lent your aid to Vrka when exhausted, and listened when invoked to &#346;ayu's calling.<br> Ye made the cow pour forth her milk like water, and, A&#347;vins, strengthened with your strength the barren.<br> 9 With his fair hymns this singer, too, extols you, waking with glad thoughts at the break of morning.<br> May the cow nourish him with milk to feed llim. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
