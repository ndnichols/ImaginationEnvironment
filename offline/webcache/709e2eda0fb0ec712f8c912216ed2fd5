<p>1 SOMA and P&#363;&#7779;an, Parents of all riches, Parents of earth and Parents of high heaven,<br> You Twain, brought forth as the whole world's protectors, the Gods have made centre of life eternal.<br> 2 At birth of these two Gods all Gods are joyful: they have caused darkness, which we hate, to vanish.<br> With these, with Soma and with P&#363;&#7779;an, India generates ripe warm milk in the raw milch-cows.<br> 3 Soma and P&#363;&#7779;an, urge your chariot hither, the seven-wheeled car that measures out the region,<br> That stirs not all, that moves to every quarter, five-reined and harnessed by the thought, ye Mighty.<br> 4 One in the heaven on high hath made his dwelling, on earth and in the firmament the other.<br> May they disclose to us great store of treasure, much-longed for, rich in food, source of enjoyment.<br> 5 One of you Twain is Parent of all creatures, the other journeys onward all-beholding.<br> Soma and P&#363;&#7779;an, aid my thought with favour: with you may we o&#8217;ercome in all encounters.<br> 6 May P&#363;&#7779;an stir our thought, the all-impelling, may Soma Lord of riches grant us riches.<br> May Aditi the perfect Goddess aid us. Loud may we speak, with heroes, in assembly.</p>
