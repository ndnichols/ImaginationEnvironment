Chapter 11</H1></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary  
and her sister Martha.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>(It was that Mary which anointed the ADONAY with ointment, and      
wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore his sisters sent unto 
him, saying, ADONAY, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>When YAHSHUA heard that, he said,   
This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of ELOHIYM, that the Son of  
ELOHIYM might be glorified thereby.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5> 
<H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Now YAHSHUA loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>When he had heard 
therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he  
was.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Then      
after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>His disciples say unto him, 
Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA answered, 
Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth 
not, because he seeth the light of this world.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>But if a man walk in the night, he           
stumbleth, because there is no light in him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>These things said he: and after that he saith   
unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of   
sleep.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Then  
said his disciples, ADONAY, if he sleep, he shall do well.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Howbeit YAHSHUA spake of his      
death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said YAHSHUA    
unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15>
<H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to    
the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said Thomas, which is    
called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with  
him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Then    
when YAHSHUA came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Now Bethany was 
nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And many of the Jews came to      
Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Martha, as soon as she heard 
that YAHSHUA was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said       
Martha unto YAHSHUA, ADONAY, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not        
died.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>But I  
know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of ELOHIYM, EL will give it       
thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>       
YAHSHUA saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Martha saith unto him, I know     
that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA said unto her, I am   
the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead,   
yet shall he live:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou 
this?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>She    
saith unto him, Yea, ADONAY: I believe that thou art the MASHIYACH, the Son of  
ELOHIYM, which should come into the world.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And when she had so said, she went her way, and 
called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for    
thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>As     
soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>Now YAHSHUA was not yet come  
into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>The Jews then which were with her 
in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily   
and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>Then when Mary  
was come where YAHSHUA was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto 
him, ADONAY, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>When YAHSHUA therefore saw    
her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the   
spirit, and was troubled.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>      
34</H4></TD><TD><P>And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him,        
ADONAY, come and see.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA wept.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>      
36</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And some of them said,    
Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even   
this man should not have died?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4> 
38</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the    
grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA said, Take ye away the stone.        
Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, ADONAY, by this time   
he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA saith unto her, Said I not unto      
thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of           
ELOHIYM?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And       
YAHSHUA lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard 
me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>And I    
knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I    
said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he thus had spoken, he   
cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>And he that was dead came forth, bound hand  
and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. YAHSHUA 
saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P>Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and   
had seen the things which YAHSHUA did, believed on him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46><H4>46</H4></TD><TD><P>But some of them went their ways  
to the Pharisees, and told them what things YAHSHUA had done.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>47</H4></TD><TD><P>Then gathered the chief       
priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth   
many miracles.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V48><H4>48</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall  
come and take away both our place and nation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V49><H4>49</H4></TD><TD><P>And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the   
high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V50><H4>50</H4></TD><TD><P>Nor consider that it 
is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole 
nation perish not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V51><H4>51</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he    
prophesied that YAHSHUA should die for that nation;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V52><H4>52</H4></TD><TD><P>And not for that nation only, but 
that also he should gather together in one the children of ELOHIYM that were    
scattered abroad.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V53><H4>53</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to    
death.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V54><H4>54</H4></TD><TD><P>      
YAHSHUA therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a  
country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued 
with his disciples.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V55><H4>55</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the        
country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V56><H4>56</H4></TD><TD><P>Then sought they for      
YAHSHUA, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think    
ye, that he will not come to the feast?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V57><H4>57</H4></TD><TD><P>Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees    
had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew    
it, that they might take him.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
