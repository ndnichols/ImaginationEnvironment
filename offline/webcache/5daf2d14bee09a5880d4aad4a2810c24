<p>1. FLOW, cheering Gods, most active, winner of the flood, for Indra, and for V&#257;yu, and for Varu&#7751;a.<br> Bestow on us to-day wide room with happiness, and in tbine ample dwelling laud the Host of Heaven.<br> 2 He who hath come anear to creatures that have life, Immortal Soma flows onward to all of them.<br> Effecting, for our aid, both union and release, Indu, like S&#363;rya, follows closely after Dawn.<br> 3 He who is poured with milk, he who within the plants hastes bringing treasure for the happiness of Gods,<br> He, poured forth in a stream flows with the lightning's flash, Soma who gladdens Indra and the Host of Heaven.<br> 4 Winner of thousands, he, this Soma, flows along, raising a vigorous voice that wakens with the dawn.<br> Indu with winds drives on the ocean of the air, he sinks within the jars, he rests in Indra's heart.<br> 5 The kine with milk dress him who makes the milk increase, Soma, amid the songs, who finds the light of heaven.<br> Winner of wealth, the effectual juice is flowing on, Singer and Sage by wisdom, dear as heaven itself.</p>
