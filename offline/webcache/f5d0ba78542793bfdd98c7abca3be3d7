thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? yea, thou shalt shew her all her

Then say thou, Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH, The city sheddeth blood in the midst

herself.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou  
art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast defiled thyself in 
thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near,   
and art come even unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto    
the heathen, and a mocking to all countries.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

thee, shall mock thee, which art infamous and much vexed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

every one were in thee to their power to shed blood.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>In thee have they set light by      
father and mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the  
stranger: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou hast despised mine     
holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit       
lewdness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>In 
thee have they discovered their fathers' nakedness: in thee have they humbled

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>In thee have they taken   
gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily

YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>       
Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou

Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>  
As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst

cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>There is a conspiracy of her      
prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have 
devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have     
made her many widows in the midst thereof.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and     
profane, neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean, 
and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>Her princes in the

seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH, 
when YHVH hath not spoken.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>     
29</H4></TD><TD><P>The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised   
robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the        
stranger wrongfully.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4>

I found none.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD>
