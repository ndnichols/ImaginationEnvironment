Chapter 20</H1></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet   
dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Then she runneth, 
and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom YAHSHUA loved, and   
saith unto them, They have taken away the ADONAY out of the sepulchre, and we   
know not where they have laid him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3>  
<H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and  
came to the sepulchre.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, 
and came first to the sepulchre.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>
5</H4></TD><TD><P>And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes   
lying; yet went he not in.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, 
and seeth the linen clothes lie,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>
7</H4></TD><TD><P>And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the   
linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Then went in also that other        
disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>For as yet they knew   
not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the disciples went away      
again unto their own home.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>     
11</H4></TD><TD><P>But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she  
wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And seeth two angels in white     
sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of      
YAHSHUA had lain.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them,     
Because they have taken away my ADONAY, and I know not where they have laid     
him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And     
when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw YAHSHUA standing, and  
knew not that it was YAHSHUA.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>  
15</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom        
seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if    
thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take    
him away.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>   
YAHSHUA saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni;  
which is to say, Master.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4>
</TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to  
my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father,   
and your Father; and to my ELOHIYM, and your EL.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Mary Magdalene came and told the  
disciples that she had seen the ADONAY, and that he had spoken these things     
unto her.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors   
were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came YAHSHUA 
and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he had so said,  
he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when  
they saw the ADONAY.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Then said YAHSHUA to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father    
hath sent me, even so send I you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22>  
<H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and      
saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted   
unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>But Thomas, one of the        
twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when YAHSHUA came.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>The other disciples therefore 
said unto him, We have seen the ADONAY. But he said unto them, Except I shall   
see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of    
the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And after eight days      
again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came YAHSHUA, the   
doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>Then saith he to     
Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy      
hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And Thomas answered  
and said unto him, My ADONAY and my ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA saith unto him, Thomas, because thou    
hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet  
have believed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And many other signs truly did YAHSHUA in the presence of his disciples,     
which are not written in this book:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31>
<H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>But these are written, that ye might believe that        
YAHSHUA is the MASHIYACH, the Son of ELOHIYM; and that believing ye might have  
life through his name.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000
