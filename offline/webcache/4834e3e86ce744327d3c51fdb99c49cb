<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>The word that came to Jeremiah  
from YHVH, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Thus speaketh YHVH ELOHIYM of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words   
that I have spoken unto thee in a book.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>For, lo, the days come, saith YHVH, that I will   
bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith YHVH: and I will 
cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall   
possess it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And these are the words that YHVH spake concerning Israel and concerning        
Judah.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>For     
thus saith YHVH; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of        
peace.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Ask ye  
now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I see every    
man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are       
turned into paleness?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the     
time of Jacob's trouble, but he shall be saved out of it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>For it shall come to pass in that   
day, saith YHVH of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and     
will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>But they shall    
serve YHVH their ELOHIYM, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto       
them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>       
Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith YHVH; neither be dismayed, O 
Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of      
their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet,    
and none shall make him afraid.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>
11</H4></TD><TD><P>For I am with thee, saith YHVH, to save thee: though I make  
a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet I will not make a  
full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee   
altogether unpunished.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>For thus saith YHVH, Thy bruise is incurable, and thy wound is      
grievous.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>   
There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no    
healing medicines.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have       
wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one,  
for the multitude of thine iniquity; because thy sins were increased.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Why criest thou for  
thine affliction? thy sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity:  
because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore all they   
that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of     
them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and   
all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>For I will restore health unto thee, and I   
will heal thee of thy wounds, saith YHVH; because they called thee an Outcast,  
saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus saith YHVH; Behold, I will   
bring again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his               
dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace 
shall remain after the manner thereof.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and  
the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not 
be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Their children also shall be  
as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will 
punish all that oppress them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>  
21</H4></TD><TD><P>And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor  
shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he 
shall approach unto me: for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto 
me? saith YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And ye shall be my people, and I will be your ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Behold, the whirlwind of YHVH     
goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the 
head of the wicked.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD>
<TD><P>The fierce anger of YHVH shall not return, until he hath done it, and    
until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall   
consider it.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John
