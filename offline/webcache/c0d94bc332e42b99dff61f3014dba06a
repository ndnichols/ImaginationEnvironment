<p>1. OF one accord, with Indra, O ye Rudras, come borne on your golden car for our prosperity.<br> An offering from us, this hymn is brought to you, as, unto one who th irsts for water, heavenly springs.<br> 2 Armed with your daggers, full of wisdom, armed with spears, armed with your quivers, armed with arrows, with good bows,<br> Good horses and good cars have ye, O P&#7771;&#347;ni's Sons: ye, Maruts, with good weapons go to victory.<br> 3 From hills and heaven ye shake wealth for the worshipper: in terror at your coming low the woods bow down.<br> Ye make the earth to tremble, Sons of P&#7771;&#347;ni, when for victory ye have yoked, fierce Ones! your spotted deer.<br> 4 Bright with the blasts of wind, wrapped in their robes of rain, like twins of noble aspect and of lovely form,<br> The Maruts, spotless, with steeds tawnyhued and red, strong in their mightiness and spreading wide like heaven.<br> 5 Rich in adornment, rich in drops, munificent, bright in their aspect, yielding bounties that endure,<br> Noble by birth, adorned with gold upon their breasts, the Singers of the sky have won immortal fame.<br> 6 Borne on both shoulders, O ye Maruts, are your spears: within your arms is laid your energy and 3trength.<br> Bold thoughts are in your heads, your weapons in your cars, all glorious majesty is moulded on your forms.<br> 7 Vouchsafe to us, O Maruts, splendid bounty in cattle and in steeds, in cars and heroes.<br> Children of Rudra, give us high distinction: may I enjoy your Godlike help and favour.<br> 8 Ho! Maruts, Heroes, skilled in Law, immortal, be gracious unto us, ye rich in treasures,<br> Ye hearers of the truth, ye sage and youthful, grown mighty, dwelling on the lofty mountains.</p>
