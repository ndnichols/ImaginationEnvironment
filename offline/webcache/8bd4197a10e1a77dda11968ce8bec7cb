<p>1. UPHOLDERS of the Law, ye strong &#256;dityas, remove my sin like her who bears in secret.<br> You, Varu&#7751;a, Mitra and all Gods who listen, I call to help me, I who know your goodness.<br> 2 Ye, Gods, are providence and ye are power: remove ye utterly all those who hate us.<br> As givers of good things deal with us kindly: this day be gracious to us and hereafter.<br> 3 What service may we do you with our future, what service, Vasus, with our ancient friendship?<br> O Aditi, and Varu&#7751;a and Mitra, Indra and Maruts, make us well and happy.<br> 4 Ye, O ye Gods, are verily our kinsmen as such be kind to me who now implore you.<br> Let not your car come slowly to our worship: of kinsmen such as you ne&#146;er let us weary.<br> 5 I singly have sinned many a sin against you, and ye chastised me as a sire the gambler.<br> Far be your nets, far, Gods, be mine offences: seize me not like a bird upon her offspring.<br> 6 Turn yourselves hitherward this day, ye Holy, that fearing in my heart I may approach you.<br> Protect us, God; let not the wolf destroy us. Save us, ye Holy, from the pit and falling.<br> 7 May I not live, O Varu&#7751;a, to witness my wealthy, liberal, dear friend's destitution.<br> King, may I never lack well-ordered riches. Loud may we speak, with heroes, in assembly.</p>
