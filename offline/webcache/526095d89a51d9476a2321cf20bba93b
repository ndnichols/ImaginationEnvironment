NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>Then came the children of Israel, even the whole  
congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people abode   
in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And there was no water for the      
congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against   
Aaron.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And the 
people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would that we had died when our     
brethren died before YHVH!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And why have ye brought up the congregation of YHVH into this       
wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And wherefore have ye made us to    
come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of    
seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water   
to drink.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the     
tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory   
of YHVH appeared unto them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>     
7</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH spake unto Moses, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock      
before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring      
forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and    
their beasts drink.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And Moses took the rod from before YHVH, as he commanded him.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses and Aaron  
gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear 
now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses lifted up his hand, and 
with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and    
the congregation drank, and their beasts also.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because 
ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel,       
therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given 
them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>This   
is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with YHVH, and   
he was sanctified in them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>     
14</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, 
Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen  
us:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>How our  
fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the   
Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And when we cried unto YHVH, he heard our       
voice, and sent an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold,  
we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Let us pass, I pray thee, through 
thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards,     
neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's high  
way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed   
thy borders.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>
And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee 
with the sword.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high way: and if 
I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it: I will only,        
without doing anything else, go through on my feet.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, Thou shalt not go    
through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong      
hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus   
Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned 
away from him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed from      
Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23>   
<H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the 
coast of the land of Edom, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24> 
<H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall    
not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because 
ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Take Aaron and Eleazar his son,   
and bring them up unto mount Hor:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26>  
<H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon       
Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die     
there.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
Moses did as YHVH commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of    
all the congregation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar 
his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar    
came down from the mount.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>      
29</H4></TD><TD><P>And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they  
mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.</P></TD></TR>
