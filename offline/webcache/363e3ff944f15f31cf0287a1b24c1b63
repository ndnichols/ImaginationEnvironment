Chapter 12</H1></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Then YAHSHUA six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus 
was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>There they made him a supper; and   
Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Then took Mary a  
pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of YAHSHUA,  
and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of    
the ointment.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should      
betray him,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the        
poor?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>This he  
said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the   
bag, and bare what was put therein.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7> 
<H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said YAHSHUA, Let her alone: against the day of my   
burying hath she kept this.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>     
8</H4></TD><TD><P>For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not      
always.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Much   
people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for      
YAHSHUA' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised    
from the dead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to          
death;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>      
Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on       
YAHSHUA.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>On  
the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that      
YAHSHUA was coming to Jerusalem,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13>   
<H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, 
and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of    
YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
YAHSHUA, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Fear not, daughter   
of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>These things understood not   
his disciples at the first: but when YAHSHUA was glorified, then remembered     
they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things 
unto him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>   
The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, 
and raised him from the dead, bare record.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>For this cause the people also met him, for     
that they heard that he had done this miracle.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>The Pharisees therefore said among           
themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after 
him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And     
there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>The same came   
therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him,        
saying, Sir, we would see YAHSHUA.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22> 
<H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and   
Philip tell YAHSHUA.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son   
of man should be glorified.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>    
24</H4></TD><TD><P>Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall  
into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth     
much fruit.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P> 
He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this      
world shall keep it unto life eternal.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>If any man serve me, let him follow me; and     
where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my    
Father honour.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this     
hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a  
voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it        
again.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>The   
people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others   
said, An angel spake to him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>   
30</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA answered and said, This voice came not because of    
me, but for your sakes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this     
world be cast out.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>This he said,   
signifying what death he should die.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>The people answered him, We have heard out of   
the law that MASHIYACH abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man    
must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>Then YAHSHUA said unto them, Yet a little while 
is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon    
you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>While ye have light,      
believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake  
YAHSHUA, and departed, and did hide himself from them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>But though he had done so many    
miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>That the saying of Esaias the     
prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Who hath believed our report? and   
to whom hath the arm of YHVH been revealed?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore they could not believe, because that  
Esaias said again,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should   
not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and 
I should heal them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD>
<TD><P>These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>Nevertheless    
among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees  
they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>For they loved the   
praise of men more than the praise of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA cried and said, He that believeth on 
me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P>And he that seeth me seeth him    
that sent me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46><H4>46</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not  
abide in darkness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>47</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I    
came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V48><H4>48</H4></TD><TD><P>He that rejecteth me, and         
receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, 
the same shall judge him in the last day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V49><H4>49</H4></TD><TD><P>For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father 
which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should   
speak.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V50><H4>50</H4></TD><TD><P>And I 
know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore,    
even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This
