<p>1. LIKE the Sun's glance, like wealth of varied sort, like breath which is the life, like one's own son,<br> Like a swift bird, a cow who yields her milk, pure and refulgent to the wood he speeds.<br> 2 He offers safety like a pleasant home, like ripened corn, the Conqueror of men.<br> Like a Seer lauding, famed among the folk; like a steed friendly he vouchsafes us power.<br> 3 With flame insatiate, like eternal might; caring for each one like a dame at home;<br> Bright when he shines forth, whitish mid the folk, like a car, gold-decked, thundering to the fight.<br> 4 He strikes with terror like a dart shot forth, e&#146;en like an archer's arrow tipped with flame;<br> Master of present and of future life, the maidens&#146; lover and the matrons&#146; Lord.<br> 5 To him lead all your ways: may we attain the kindled God as cows their home at eve.<br> He drives the flames below as floods their swell: the rays rise up to the fair place of heaven.</p>
