<p>1. LET your best-bearing car that must be lauded, ne&#146;er injured, bring you V&#257;jas and &#7770;bhuk&#7779;ans.<br> Fill you, fair-helmeted! with mighty Soma, thrice-mixed, at our libations to delight you.<br> 2 Ye who behold the light of heaven, &#7770;bhuk&#7779;ans, give our rich patrons unmolested riches.<br> Drink, heavenly-natured. at our sacrifices, and give us bounties for the hymns we sing you.<br> 3 For thou, O Bounteous One, art used to giving, at parting treasure whether small or ample.<br> Filled full are both thine arms with great possessions: thy goodness keeps thee not from granting riches.<br> 4 Indra, high-famed, as V&#257;ja and &#7770;bhuk&#7779;ans, thou goest working, singing to the dwelling.<br> Lord of Bay Steeds, this day may we Vasisthas offer our prayers to thee and bring oblations.<br> 5 Thou winnest swift advancement for thy servant, through hymns, Lord of Bay Steeds, which thou hast favoured.<br> For thee with friendly succour have we battled, and when, O Indra, wilt thou grant us riches?<br> 6 To us thy priests a home, as &#146;twere, thou givest: when, Indra wilt thou recognize our praises?<br> May thy strong Steed, through our ancestral worship, bring food and wealth with heroes to our dwelling.<br> 7 Though Nirrti the Goddess reigneth round him, Autumns with food in plenty come to Indra.<br> With three close Friends to length of days he cometh, he whom men let not rest at home in quiet.<br> 8 Promise us gifts, O Savitar: may riches come unto us in Parvata's full bounty.<br> May the Celestial Guardian still attend us. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
