<p>1. THOU wast born mighty for victorious valour, exulting, strongest, full of pride and courage.<br> There, even there, the Maruts strengthened Indra when. his most rapid Mother stirred the Hero.<br> 2 There with fiend's ways e&#146;en P&#7771;&#347;ni was seated: with much laudation they exalted Indra.<br> As if encompassed by the Mighty-footed, from darkness, near at hand, forth came the Children.<br> 3 High are thy feet when on thy way thou goest: the strength thou foundest here hath lent thee vigour.<br> Thousand hyenas in thy mouth thou holdest. O Indra, mayst thou turn the A&#347;vins hither.<br> 4 Speeding at once to sacrifice thou comest for friendship thou art bringing both N&#257;satyas.<br> Thou hadst a thousand treasures in possession. The A&#347;vins, O thou Hero, gave thee riches.<br> 5 Glad, for the race that rests on holy Order, with friends who hasten to their goal, hath Indra<br> With these his magic powers assailed the Dasyu: he cast away the gloomy mists, the darkness.<br> 6 Two of like name for him didst thou demolish, as Indra striking down the car of U&#7779;as.<br> With thy beloved lofty Friends thou camest, and with the assurance of thine heart thou slewest.<br> 7 War-loving Namuci thou smotest, robbing the D&#257;sa of his magic for the &#7770;&#7779;i.<br> For man thou madest ready pleasant pathways, paths leading as it were directly God-ward.<br> 8 These names of thine thou hast fulfilled completely: as Lord, thou boldest in thine arm, O Indra.<br> In thee, through thy great might, the Gods are joyful: the roots of trees hast thou directed upward.<br> 9 May the sweet Soma juices make him happy to cast his quoit that lies in depth of waters.<br> Thou from the udder which o&#146;er earth is fastened hast poured the milk into the kine and herbage.<br> 10 When others call him offspring of the Courser, my meaning is that Mighty Power produced him.<br> He came from Manyu and remained in houses: whence he hath sprung is known to Indra only.<br> 11 Like birds of beauteous wing the Priyamedhas, &#7770;&#7779;is, imploring, have come nigh to Indra:<br> Dispel the darkness and fill full our vision deliver us as men whom snares entangle.</p>
