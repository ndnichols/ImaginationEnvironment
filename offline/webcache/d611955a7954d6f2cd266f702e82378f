<TD><P>The word of YHVH that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of  
Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam 
the son of Joash, king of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2>   
<H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>The beginning of the word of YHVH by Hosea. And YHVH said 
to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: for 
the land hath committed great whoredom, departing from YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>So he went and took Gomer the   
daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH said unto him, Call his    
name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel    
upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of     
Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And it 
shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel, in the     
valley of Jezreel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And said unto him, Call    
her name Loruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but 
I will utterly take them away.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>

them by YHVH their ELOHIYM, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by 
battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8> 
<H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and     
bare a son.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Then said, Call his name Loammi: for ye are not my people, and I will not be    
your.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Yet    
the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which     
cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place   
where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto  
them, Ye are the sons of the living EL.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and   
they shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel.</P>
