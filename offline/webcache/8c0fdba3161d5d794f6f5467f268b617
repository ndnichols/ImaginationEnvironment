NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying,   
Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our      
father's hath he gotten all this glory.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and,   
behold, it was not toward him as before.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of 
thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And Jacob sent and called Rachel    
and Leah to the field unto his flock,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the ELOHIYM of my father   
hath been with me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And your father hath   
deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but ELOHIYM suffered him not to    
hurt me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>If he 
said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled:

cattle ring-streaked.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Thus ELOHIYM hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them   
to me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine    
eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle    
were ring-streaked, speckled, and grizzled.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And the angel of ELOHIYM spake unto me in a     
dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see,   
all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ring-streaked, speckled, and        
grizzled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>I am the EL of Bethel, where thou 
anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get     
thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And Rachel and Leah       
answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in   
our father's house?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite 
devoured also our money.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4>
</TD><TD><P>For all the riches which ELOHIYM hath taken from our father, that   
is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever ELOHIYM hath said unto thee,  
do.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Then     
Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And he carried away all his       
cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which 
he had gotten in Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of        
Canaan.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her   
father's.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that 
he fled.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>So  
he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and    
set his face toward the mount Gilead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And it was told Laban on the third day that     
Jacob was fled.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days'         
journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And ELOHIYM came to Laban the     
Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to 
Jacob either good or bad.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>      
25</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in 
the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And Laban said to    
Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and      
carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore didst thou flee     
away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have 
sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And hast not         
suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in   
so doing.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>It 
is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the ELOHIYM of your father spake 
unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either 
good or bad.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>
And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after   
thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And Jacob answered and said   
to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by  
force thy daughters from me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>   
32</H4></TD><TD><P>With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live:     
before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee.    
For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into   
Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then  
went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>Now Rachel had taken the      
images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban     
searched all the tent, but found them not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And she said to her father, Let it not          
displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is 
upon me. And he searched but found not the images.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>And Jacob was wroth, and chode    
with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is  
my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>Whereas thou hast searched all my 
stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my   
brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>This twenty years have I  
been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the   
rams of thy flock have I not eaten.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39>
<H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I 
bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day,   
or stolen by night.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night;  
and my sleep departed from mine eyes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I   
served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: 
and thou hast changed my wages ten times.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>Except the ELOHIYM of my father, the ELOHIYM of 
Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me     
away now empty. ELOHIYM hath seen mine affliction and the labor of my hands,    
and rebuked thee yesternight.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>  
43</H4></TD><TD><P>And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are  
my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my       
cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these  
my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>Now therefore come thou, let us   
make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and         
thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V46><H4>46</H4></TD><TD><P>And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather     
stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the 
heap.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>47</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V48><H4>48</H4></TD><TD><P>And Laban said, This heap is  
a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called     
Galeed;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V49><H4>49</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
Mizpah; for he said, YHVH watch between me and thee, when we are absent one     
from another.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V50><H4>50</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside 
my daughters, no man is with us; see, ELOHIYM is witness betwixt me and         
thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V51><H4>51</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have     
cast betwixt me and thee:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V52><H4>      
52</H4></TD><TD><P>This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I     
will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this    
heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V53><H4>53</H4></TD><TD><P>The ELOHIYM of Abraham, and the ELOHIYM of      
Nahor, the ELOHIYM of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the    
fear of his father Isaac.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V54><H4>      
54</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his  
brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the     
mount.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V55><H4>55</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and  
blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.</P></TD></TR>
