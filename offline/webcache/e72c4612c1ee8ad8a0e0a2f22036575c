<p>1. HE who seeks furtherance and grace to help him goes to the Son of Strength with newest worship,<br> Calling the heavenly Priest to share the banquet, who rends the wood, bright, with his blackened pathway.<br> 2 White-hued and thundering he dwells in splendour, Most Youthful, with the loudvoiced and eternal-<br> Agni, most variform, the Purifier, who follows crunching many ample forests.<br> 3 Incited by the wind thy flames, O Agni, move onward, Pure One! pure, in all directions.<br> Thy most destructive heavenly Navagvas break the woods down and devastate them boldly.<br> 4 Thy pure white horses from their bonds are loosened: O Radiant One, they shear the ground beneath them,<br> And far and wide shines out thy flame, and flickers rapidly moving over earth's high ridges.<br> 5 Forth darts the Bull's tongue like the sharp stone weapon discharged by him who fights to win the cattle.<br> Agni's fierce flame is like a hero's onset: dread and resistless he destroys the forests.<br> 6 Thou with the sunlight of the great Impeller hast boldly over-spread the earth's expanses.<br> So drive away with conquering might all perils. fighting out foemen burn up those who harm us.<br> 7 Wondrous! of wondrous power! give to the singer wealth wondrous, marked, most wonderful, life-giving.<br> Wealth bright, O Bright One, vast, with many heroes, give with thy bright flames to the man who lauds thee.</p>
