<p>1. FLYING, with falcons, may your chariot, A&#347;vins, most gracious, bringing friendly<br> help, come hither,&#151;<br> Your chariot, swifter than the mind of mortal, fleet as the wind, three-seated O ye Mighty.<br> 2 Come to us with your chariot triple seated, three-wheeled, of triple form, that rolleth lightly.<br> Fill full our cows, give mettle to our horses, and make each hero son grow strong, O A&#347;vins.<br> 3 With your well-rolling car, descending swiftly, hear this the press-stone's song, ye Wonder-Workers.<br> How then have ancient sages said, O A&#347;vins, that ye most swiftly come to stay affliction?<br> 4 O A&#347;vins, let your falcons bear you hither, yoked to your chariot, swift, with flying pinions,<br> Which, ever active, like the airy eagles, carry you, O N&#257;satyas, to the banquet.<br> 5 The youthful Daughter of the Sun, delighting in you, ascended there your chariot, Heroes.<br> Borne on their swift wings let your beauteous horses, your birds of ruddy hue, convey you near us.<br> 6 Ye raised up Vandana, strong Wonder-Workers! with great might, and with power ye rescued Rebha.<br> From out the sea ye saved the son of Tugra, and gave his youth again unto Cyav&#257;na.<br> 7 To Atri, cast down to the fire that scorched him, ye gave, O A&#347;vins, strengthening food and favour.<br> Accepting his fair praises with approval, ye gave his eyes again to blinded Ka&#7751;va.<br> 8 For ancient &#346;ayu in his sore affliction ye caused his cow to swell with milk, O A&#347;vins.<br> The quail from her great misery ye delivered, and a new leg for Vi&#347;pal&#257; provided.<br> 9 A white horse, A&#347;vins, ye bestowed on Pedu, a serpent-slaying steed sent down by Indra,<br> Loud-neighing, conquering the foe, high-mettled, firm-limbed and vigorous, winning thousand treasures.<br> 10 Such as ye are, O nobly born, O Heroes, we in our trouble call on you for succour.<br> Accepting these our songs, for our wellbeing come to us on your chariot treasure-laden.<br> 11 Come unto us combined in love, N&#257;satyas come with the fresh swift vigour of the falcon.<br> Bearing oblations I invoke you, A&#347;vins, at the first break of everlasting morning.</p>
