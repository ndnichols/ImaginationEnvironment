<p>1. INSTALL at sacrifice, while the rite advances, your pleasant, heavenly Agni, meet for praises.<br> With hymns-for he illumines us-install him. He, J&#257;tavedas, makes our rites successful.<br> 2 Hear this laud, Radiant Priest of many aspects, O Agni with the fires of man enkindled,<br> Laud which bards send forth pure as sacred butter, strength to this man, as &#146;twere for self-advantage.<br> 3 Mid mortal men that singer thrives in glory who offers gifts with hymns of praise to Agni,<br> And the God, wondrous bright, with wondrous succours helps him to win a stable filled with cattle.<br> 4 He, at his birth, whose path is black behind him, filled heaven and earth with far-apparent splendour:<br> And he himself hath been. through night's thick darkness, made manifest by light, the Purifier.<br> 5 With thy most mighty aid, confer, O Agni, wonderful wealth on us and on our princes,<br> Who stand preeminent, surpassing others in liberal gifts, in fame, and hero virtues.<br> 6 Agni, accept this sacrifice with gladness, which, seated here, the worshipper presenteth.<br> Fair hymns hadst thou among the Bharadv&#257;jas, and holpest them to gain abundant vigour.<br> 7 Scatter our foes, increase our store. May we he glad a hundred winters with brave sons.</p>
