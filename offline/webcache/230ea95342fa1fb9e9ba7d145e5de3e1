NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass at the end of two full years, 
that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And, behold, there came up out of   
the river seven well favored kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And, behold,      
seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favored and           
leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And the ill favored    
and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favored and fat kine. So Pharaoh 
awoke.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And he  
slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon 
one stalk, rank and good.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung  
up after them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>
And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh      
awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8> 
<H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was    
troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the    
wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that      
could interpret them unto Pharaoh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9>  
<H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do    
remember my faults this day:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>   
10</H4></TD><TD><P>Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in   
the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And we dreamed a dream in one 
night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his     
dream.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the   
guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man        
according to his dream he did interpret.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us,   
so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Pharaoh sent and called  
Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, 
and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I   
have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard 
say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And Joseph answered       
Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: ELOHIYM shall give Pharaoh an answer of       
peace.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the     
river:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And,  
behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favored; 
and they fed in a meadow:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>      
19</H4></TD><TD><P>And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and   
very ill favored and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt  
for badness:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>
And the lean and the ill favored kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they   
had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they     
were still ill favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And I saw in my dream, and,       
behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And, behold, seven ears,          
withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And the thin ears    
devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was 
none that could declare it to me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25>  
<H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is    
one: ELOHIYM hath showed Pharaoh what he is about to do.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>The seven good kine are seven     
years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And the seven thin and    
ill favored kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty   
ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>This is the thing which I 
have spoken unto Pharaoh: What ELOHIYM is about to do he showeth unto           
Pharaoh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of       
Egypt:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be 
forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And the plenty shall 
not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be    
very grievous.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the     
thing is established by ELOHIYM, and ELOHIYM will shortly bring it to pass.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>Now therefore   
let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of      
Egypt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>Let   
Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the    
fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And let them gather all the   
food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh,  
and let them keep food in the cities.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>And that food shall be for store to the land    
against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that    
the land perish not through the famine.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh,  
and in the eyes of all his servants.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find 
such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of ELOHIYM is?</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, 
Forasmuch as ELOHIYM hath showed thee all this, there is none so discreet and   
wise as thou art:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my    
people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>And Pharaoh said unto     
Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>And Pharaoh took off his ring     
from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of    
fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>And he made him to ride in the    
second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he    
made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and 
without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P>And Pharaoh     
called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the       
daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of   
Egypt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46><H4>46</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And     
Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land  
of Egypt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>47</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V48><H4>48</H4></TD><TD><P>And he gathered up   
all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up   
the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every      
city, laid he up in the same.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V49><H4>  
49</H4></TD><TD><P>And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much,  
until he left numbering; for it was without number.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V50><H4>50</H4></TD><TD><P>And unto Joseph were born two     
sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah  
priest of On bare unto him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V51><H4>    
51</H4></TD><TD><P>And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For    
ELOHIYM, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's          
house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V52><H4>52</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
the name of the second called he Ephraim: For ELOHIYM hath caused me to be      
fruitful in the land of my affliction.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A
