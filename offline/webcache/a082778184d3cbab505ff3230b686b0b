Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, Behold, I have heard   
that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence;  
that we may live, and not die.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>

</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>But Benjamin,     
Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest           
peradventure mischief befall him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5>   
<H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that  
came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And Joseph was the governor over the land, and 
he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came,  
and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And Joseph saw his     
brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake       
roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From   
the land of Canaan to buy food.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>

</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And Joseph remembered  
the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see   
the nakedness of the land ye are come.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

buy food are thy servants come.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>

no spies.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are         
come.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of 
Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is       
not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And     
Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are         
spies:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>      
Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence,  
except your youngest brother come hither.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Send one of you, and let him fetch your         
brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether 
there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are         
spies.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
he put them all together into ward three days.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And Joseph said unto them the third day,     
This do, and live; for I fear ELOHIYM:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be  
bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your     
houses:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>But  
bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye    
shall not die. And they did so.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>
21</H4></TD><TD><P>And they said one to another, We are verily guilty           
concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he         
besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And Reuben      
answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the     
child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And they knew   
not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And he turned   
himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed     
with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Joseph          
commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into  
his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And they laded  
their asses with the corn, and departed thence.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And as one of them opened his sack to give   
his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his   
sack's mouth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in  
my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to       
another, What is this that ELOHIYM hath done unto us?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And they came unto Jacob their    
father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them;         
saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>The  
man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of 
the country.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>
And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>We be twelve brethren, sons of    
our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the     
land of Canaan.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that 
ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the 
famine of your households, and be gone:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>And bring your youngest brother unto me: then   
shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver  
you your brother, and ye shall traffic in the land.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass as they       
emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: 
and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were         
afraid.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph   
is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are 
against me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not  
to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, My son  
shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if   
mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my  
gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
