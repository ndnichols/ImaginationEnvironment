<p>1. WHOSO to Agni hath endeared his thought and service by his hymns,<br> That mortal cats before the rest, and finds sufficiency of food.<br> 2 Agni, in truth, is passing wise, most skilled in ordering, a Seer.<br> At sacrifices Manus' sons glorify Agni as their Priest.<br> 3 The foeman's wealth in many a place, Agni, is emulous to help.<br> Men fight the fiend, and seek by rites to overcome the riteless foe.<br> 4 Agni bestows the hero chief, winner of waters, firm in fray.<br> Soon as they look upon his might his enemies tremble in alarm.<br> 5 For with his wisdom Agni, God, protects the mortal from reproach,<br> Whose conquering wealth is never checked, is never checked in deeds of might.<br> 6 O Agni, God with Mitra's might call hither the favour of the Gods from earth and heaven.<br> Bring weal from heaven that men may dwell securely. May we o&#146;ercome the foe's malign oppressions, may we o&#146;ercome them, through thy help o&#146;ercome them.</p>
