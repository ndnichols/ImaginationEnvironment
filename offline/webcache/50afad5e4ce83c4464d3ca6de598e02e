<p>1. THE Father of the eye, the Wise in spirit, created both these worlds submerged in fatness.<br> Then when the eastern ends were firmly fastened, the heavens and the earth were far extended.<br> 2 Mighty in mind and power is Visvakarman, Maker, Disposer, and most lofty Presence.<br> Their offerings joy in rich juice where they value One, only One, beyond the Seven &#7770;&#7779;is.<br> 3 Father who made us, he who, as Disposer, knoweth all races and all things existing,<br> Even he alone, the Deities' narne-giver,him other beings seek for information.<br> 4 To him in sacrifice they offered treasures,&#151;&#7770;&#7779;is of old, in numerous troops, as singers,<br> Who, in the distant, near, and lower region, made ready all these things that have existence.<br> 5 That which is earlier than this earth and heaven, before the Asuras and Gods had being,&#151;<br> What was the germ primeval which the waters received where all the Gods were seen together?<br> 6 The waters, they received that germ primeval wherein the Gods were gathefed all together.<br> It rested set upon the Unborn's navel, that One wherein abide all things existing.<br> 7 Ye will not find him who produced these creatures: another thing hath risen up among you.<br> Enwrapt in misty cloud, with lips that stammer, hymn-chanters wander and are discontented.</p>
