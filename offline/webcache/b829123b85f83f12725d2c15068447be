NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH appeared unto him in the plains of       
Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And he lift up his eyes and looked, 
and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from 
the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And said, My ADONAY, if now I have  
found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Let a little water, I  
pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the         
tree:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And I    
will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall   
pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as    
thou hast said.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly  
three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And Abraham ran unto   
the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and 
he hasted to dress it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed,    
and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did       
eat.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And they  
said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, I  
will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah   
thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was       
behind him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be    
with Sarah after the manner of women.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, 
After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH said unto   
Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child,   
which am old?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Is any thing too hard for YHVH? At the time appointed I will return unto     
thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Sarah denied,        
saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst     
laugh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with     
them to bring them on the way.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4> 
17</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I  
do;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Seeing   
that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations 
of the earth shall be blessed in him?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>For I know him, that he will command his        
children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of YHVH, to   
do justice and judgment; that YHVH may bring upon Abraham that which he hath    
spoken of him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And YHVH said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because   
their sin is very grievous;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>    
21</H4></TD><TD><P>I will go down now, and see whether they have done           
altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I     
will know.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham  
stood yet before YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the         
righteous with the wicked?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>     
24</H4></TD><TD><P>Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt  
thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are      
therein?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>    
That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the   
wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee:  
Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH said, If I find in Sodom fifty      
righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And Abraham     
answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the ADONAY,   
which am but dust and ashes:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>   
28</H4></TD><TD><P>Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous:   
wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there   
forty and five, I will not destroy it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And he spake unto him yet again, and said,      
Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it    
for forty's sake.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And he said unto him, Oh let not the ADONAY be angry, and I will speak:  
Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it,  
if I find thirty there.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the     
ADONAY: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not 
destroy it for twenty's sake.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>  
32</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, Oh let not the ADONAY be angry, and I will      
speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I  
will not destroy it for ten's sake.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33>
<H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH went his way, as soon as he had left communing  
with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
