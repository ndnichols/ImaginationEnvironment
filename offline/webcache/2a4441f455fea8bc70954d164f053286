Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there,    
named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed;  
but his father was a Greek:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>     
2</H4></TD><TD><P>Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at       
Lystra and Iconium.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him   
because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his    
father was a Greek.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for 
to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at            
Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number          
daily.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Now     
when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were       
forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>After they were come to Mysia, they 
assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And they passing by Mysia came  
down to Troas.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>
And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and 
prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And after he had seen the vision, 
immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the   
ADONAY had called us for to preach the gospel unto them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore loosing from Troas, we  
came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And from thence 
to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony:   
and we were in that city abiding certain days.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And on the sabbath we went out of the city   
by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake   
unto the women which resorted thither.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of    
purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped ELOHIYM, heard us: whose      
heart the ADONAY opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of 
Paul.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have   
judged me to be faithful to the ADONAY, come into my house, and abide there.    
And she constrained us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel         
possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much    
gain by soothsaying:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the 
servants of the ELYOWN EL, which shew unto us the way of salvation.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And this did she     
many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command    
thee in the name of YAHSHUA MASHIYACH to come out of her. And he came out the   
same hour.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught     
Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers,</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And brought them to  
the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our      
city,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe,      
being Romans.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent    
off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they had laid many stripes upon     
them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Who, having     
received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet  
fast in the stocks.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto ELOHIYM:    
and the prisoners heard them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>  
26</H4></TD><TD><P>And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the       
foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were       
opened, and every one's bands were loosed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his 
sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have  
killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>But Paul cried with a loud    
voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Then he called for a light, and   
sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And brought them     
out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And they said, Believe on the     
ADONAY YAHSHUA MASHIYACH, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And they spake unto him   
the word of YHVH, and to all that were in his house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And he took them the same hour of 
the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his,          
straightway.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>
And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and       
rejoiced, believing in ELOHIYM with all his house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And when it was day, the          
magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>And the keeper of the prison told 
this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore     
depart, and go in peace.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4>
</TD><TD><P>But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned,    
being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out       
privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>And the serjeants    
told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that    
they were Romans.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them  
to depart out of the city.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>     
40</H4></TD><TD><P>And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house  
of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and         
departed.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M.
