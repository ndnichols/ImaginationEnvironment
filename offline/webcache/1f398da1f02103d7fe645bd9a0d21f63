<p>1. HIGH hath the Mighty risen before the dawning, and come to us with light from out the darkness.<br> Fair-shapen Agni with white-shining splendour hath filled at birth all human habitations.<br> 2 Thou, being born, art Child of Earth and Heaven, parted among the plants in beauty, Agni!<br> The glooms of night thou, Brilliant Babe, subduest, and art come forth, loud roaring, from thy Mothers.<br> 3 Here, being manifested, lofty Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, full wise, protects his own supremest station.<br> When they have offered in his mouth their sweet milk, to him with one accord they sing forth praises.<br> 4 Thence bearing food the Mothers come to meet thee, with food for thee who givest food its increase.<br> These in their altered form again thou meetest. Thou art Invoking Priest in homes of mortals.<br> 5 Priest of the holy rite, with car that glitters, refulgent Banner of each act of worship,<br> Sharinging every God through might and glory, even Agni Guest of men I summon hither.<br> 6 So Agni stands on earth's most central station, invested in well-decorated garments.<br> Born, red of hue, where men pour out libations, O King, as great High Priest bring the Gods hither.<br> 7 Over the earth and over heaven, O Agni, thou, Son, hast ever spread above thy Parents.<br> Come, Youthfullest! to those who long to meet thee, and hither bring the Gods, O Mighty Victor.</p>
