Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name  
was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of  
Zuph, an Ephrathite:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of    
the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And this man went 
up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto YHVH of hosts in     
Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of YHVH, were 
there.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And     
when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to    
all her sons and her daughters, portions:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he  
loved Hannah: but YHVH had shut up her womb.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to  
make her fret, because YHVH had shut up her womb.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And as he did so year by year, when 
she went up to the house of YHVH, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and  
did not eat.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest  
thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten        
sons?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>So       
Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now    
Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of YHVH.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And she was in bitterness 
of soul, and prayed unto YHVH, and wept sore.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And she vowed a vow, and said, O YHVH of     
hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and        
remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a 
man child, then I will give him unto YHVH all the days of his life, and there   
shall no razor come upon his head.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12> 
<H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, as she continued praying before     
YHVH, that Eli marked her mouth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13>   
<H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, 
but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And Eli said    
unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And Hannah answered  
and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither 
wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before YHVH.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Count not thine handmaid  
for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief    
have I spoken hitherto.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the ELOHIYM of Israel  
grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And she said, Let thine handmaid  
find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her        
countenance was no more sad.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>   
19</H4></TD><TD><P>And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before 
YHVH, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah   
his wife; and YHVH remembered her.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20> 
<H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about  
after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel,    
saying, Because I have asked him of YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up 
to offer unto YHVH the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>But Hannah went not up; for she   
said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I   
will bring him, that he may appear before YHVH, and there abide for ever.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And Elkanah her 
husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned  
him; only YHVH establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck    
until she weaned him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three   
bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto    
the house of YHVH in Shiloh: and the child was young.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And they slew a bullock, and      
brought the child to Eli.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>      
26</H4></TD><TD><P>And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am  
the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>For this child I prayed; and YHVH 
hath given me my petition which I asked of him:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore also I have lent him to YHVH; as   
long as he liveth he shall be lent to YHVH. And he worshipped YHVH there.</P>
