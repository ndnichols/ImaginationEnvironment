YAHSHUA, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long        
season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some 
miracle done by him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD>

nothing.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And

I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And they were instant with loud voices,      
requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief   
priests prevailed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD>

them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had       
desired; but he delivered YAHSHUA to their will.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And as they led him away, they    
laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him     
they laid the cross, that he might bear it after YAHSHUA.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And there followed him a great    
company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>But YAHSHUA turning  
unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for           
yourselves, and for your children.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29> 
<H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they      
shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps  
which never gave suck.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to   
the hills, Cover us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in  
the dry?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they   
were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and  
the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said YAHSHUA,        
Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his       
raiment, and cast lots.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them       
derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be MASHIYACH, 
the chosen of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him   
vinegar,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>And a superscription also was     
written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING   
OF THE JEWS.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>
And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be  
MASHIYACH, save thyself and us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>
40</H4></TD><TD><P>But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou   
fear ELOHIYM, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>And we indeed justly; for we      
receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said     
unto YAHSHUA, ADONAY, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA said     
unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>And it was      
about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the     
ninth hour.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46><H4>46</H4></TD><TD><P>And when        
YAHSHUA had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend  
my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>47</H4></TD><TD><P>Now when the centurion saw what   
was done, he glorified ELOHIYM, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V48><H4>48</H4></TD><TD><P>And all the     
people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done,  
smote their breasts, and returned.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V49> 
<H4>49</H4></TD><TD><P>And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed    
him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that
