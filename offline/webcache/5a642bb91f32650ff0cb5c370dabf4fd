</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>Do we begin again 
to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to   
you, or letters of commendation from you?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known   
and read of all men:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of MASHIYACH   
ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living EL;   
not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And such trust have we through      
MASHIYACH:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Not 
that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our 
sufficiency is of ELOHIYM;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of   
the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth    
life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>But if   
the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so     
that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for   
the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>How shall not the ministration  
of the spirit be rather glorious?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9>   
<H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much    
more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>For even that which was made  
glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that              
excelleth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>  
For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is  
glorious.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And not as Moses,    
which put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not           
stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>But their minds were blinded: for 
until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old   
testament; which vail is done away in MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>But even unto this day, when      
Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Nevertheless when it shall turn to the ADONAY,  
the vail shall be taken away.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>  
17</H4></TD><TD><P>Now YHVH is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of YHVH is,    
there is liberty.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of YHVH,    
are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of   
YHVH.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M. Hurt,
