<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>The word which came unto        
Jeremiah from YHVH in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah,    
saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Go     
unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the  
house of YHVH, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Then I took Jaazaniah  
the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, 
and the whole house of the Rechabites;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And I brought them into the house of YHVH, into   
the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of ELOHIYM, which  
was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the  
son of Shallum, the keeper of the door:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And I set before the sons of the house of the     
Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>But they said, We 
will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us,      
saying, Ye shall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your sons for ever:</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Neither shall ye build

strangers.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all    
that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our      
sons, nor our daughters;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4>

nor field, nor seed:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to  
all that Jonadab our father commanded us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king   
of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to          
Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of    
the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Then came the word of YHVH unto Jeremiah,       
saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus 
saith YHVH of hosts, the ELOHIYM of Israel; Go and tell the men of Judah and    
the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my  
words? saith YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not   
to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they drink none, but obey their 
father's commandment: notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, rising early and  
speaking; but ye hearkened not unto me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>I have sent also unto you all my servants the   
prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man     
from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve  
them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your      
fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Because the sons of       
Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father, which 
he commanded them; but this people hath not hearkened unto me:</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore thus saith YHVH     
ELOHIYM of hosts, the ELOHIYM of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon Judah and    
upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced       
against them: because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and I   
have called unto them, but they have not answered.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And Jeremiah said unto the house  
of the Rechabites, Thus saith YHVH of hosts, the ELOHIYM of Israel; Because ye  
have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts,  
and done according unto all that he hath commanded you:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore thus saith YHVH of      
hosts, the ELOHIYM of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to 
stand before me for ever.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright
