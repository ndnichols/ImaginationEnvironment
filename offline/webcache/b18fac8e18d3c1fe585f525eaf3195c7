<p>1. SWIFT gain is his who hath you near at every rite: ye welcome every song of him who serves the Gods.<br> So may I turn you hither with fair hymns of praise to give great succour for the weal of both the worlds.<br> 2 Surrounding, as it were, self-born, self-powerful, they spring to life the shakers-down of food and light;<br> Like as the countess undulations of the floods, worthy of praise when near, like bullocks and like kine.<br> 3 They who, like Somas with their well-grown stalks pressed out, imbibed within the heart, dwell there in friendly wise.<br> Upon their shoulders rests as &#146;twere a warrior's spear and in their hand they hold a dagger and a ring.<br> 4 Self-yoked they have descended lightly from the sky. With your own lash, Immortals, urge yourselves to speed.<br> Unstained by dust the Maruts, mighty in their strength, have cast down e&#146;en firm things, armed with their shining spears.<br> 5 Who among you, O Maruts armed with lightning-spears, moveth you by himself, as with the tongue his jaws?<br> Ye rush from heaven's floor as though ye sought for food, on many errands like the Sun's diurnal Steed.<br> 6 Say where, then, is this mighty region's farthest bound, where, Maruts, is the lowest depth that ye have reached,<br> When ye cast down like chaff the firmly stablished pile, and from the mountain send the glittering water-flood?<br> 7 Your winning is with strength, dazzling, with heavenly light, with fruit mature, O Maruts, fall of plenteousness.<br> Auspicious is your gift like a free giver's meed, victorious, spreading far, as of immortal Gods.<br> 8 The rivers roar before your chariot fellies when they are uttering the voice of rain-clouds.<br> The lightnings laugh upon the earth beneath them, what time the Maruts scatter forth their fatness.<br> 9 P&#7771;&#347;ni brought forth, to fight the mighty battle, the glittering army of the restless Maruts.<br> Nurtured together they begat the monster, and then looked round them for the food that strengthens.<br> 10 May this your laud, may this your song O Maruts, sung by the poet M&#257;na's son, M&#257;nd&#257;rya,<br> Bring offspring for ourselves with food to feed us. May we find strengthening food in full abundance.</p>
