year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth    
year, and in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which  
was of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of YHVH, in the presence of the       
priests and of all the people, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus speaketh YHVH of hosts, the ELOHIYM of       
Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Within two full years will I    
bring again into this place all the vessels of YHVH's house, that               
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to   
Babylon:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And I 
will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah,     
with all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, saith YHVH: for I will  
break the yoke of the king of Babylon.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet   
Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people  
that stood in the house of YHVH,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>
6</H4></TD><TD><P>Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: YHVH do so: YHVH        
perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of     
YHVH's house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this      
place.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>        
Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the     
ears of all the people;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old        
prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and 
of evil, and of pestilence.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>     
9</H4></TD><TD><P>The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the  
prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that YHVH hath     
truly sent him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD>
<P>Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's      
neck, and brake it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith 
YHVH; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the  
neck of all nations within the space of two full years. And the prophet         
Jeremiah went his way.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>Then the word of YHVH came unto Jeremiah the prophet, after that    
Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet       
Jeremiah, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith YHVH; Thou hast broken the      
yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>For thus saith YHVH of hosts, the 
ELOHIYM of Israel; I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these         
nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall     
serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said the prophet         
Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; YHVH hath not sent      
thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore thus saith YHVH;        
Behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt   
die, because thou hast taught rebellion against YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD
