VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>Paul, an apostle of YAHSHUA         
MASHIYACH by the commandment of ELOHIYM our Saviour, and ADONAY YAHSHUA         
MASHIYACH, which is our hope;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>

peace, from ELOHIYM our Father and YAHSHUA MASHIYACH our ADONAY.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>As I besought thee to abide 
still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some    
that they teach no other doctrine,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4>  
<H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies,      
which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so      
do.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Now the    
end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good            
conscience, and of faith unfeigned:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6> 
<H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>From which some having swerved have turned aside unto     
vain jangling;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>
Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor    
whereof they affirm.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Knowing this, that the law  
is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the   
ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and   
murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>For whoremongers, for them that defile          
themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and  
if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>According to the glorious 
gospel of the blessed ELOHIYM, which was committed to my trust.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And I thank MASHIYACH     
YAHSHUA our ADONAY, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful,       
putting me into the ministry;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>  
13</H4></TD><TD><P>Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and           
injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And the grace   
of our ADONAY was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in MASHIYACH  
YAHSHUA.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>    
This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that MASHIYACH        
YAHSHUA came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Howbeit for this cause I  
obtained mercy, that in me first YAHSHUA MASHIYACH might shew forth all         
longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to   
life everlasting.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD>
