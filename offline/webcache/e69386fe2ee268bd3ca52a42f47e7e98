<p>1. OFFER oblations in his mouth, the bounteous God's whom we must serve.<br> His who is nearest kin to us:<br> 2 Who for the Fivefold People's take hath seated him in every home<br> Wise, Youthful, Master of the house.<br> 3 On all sides may that Agni guard our household folk and property;<br> May he deliver us from woe.<br> 4 I have begotten this new hymn for Agni, Falcon of the sky:<br> Will he not give us of his wealth?<br> 5 Whose lories when he glows in front of sacrite are fair to see,<br> Like wealth of one with hero sons.<br> 6 May he enjoy this hallowed gift, Agni accept our songs, who bears<br> Oblations, best of worshippers.<br> 7 Lord of the house, whom men must seek, we set thee down, O Worshipped Onel<br> Bright, rich in heroes, Agni! God<br> 8 Shine forth at night and morn: through thee with fires are we provided well.<br> Thou, rich in heroes, art our Friend.<br> 9 The men come near thee for their gain, the singers with their songs of praise:<br> Speech, thousandfold, comes near to thee.<br> 10 Bright, Purifier, meet for praise, Immortal with refulgent glow,<br> Agni drives R&#257;k&#7779;asas away.<br> 11 As such, bring us abundant wealth, young Child of Strength, for this thou canst<br> May Bhaga give us what is choice.<br> 12 Thou, Agni, givest hero fame: Bhaga and Savitar the God,<br> And Did give us what is good.<br> 13 Agni, preserve us from distress: consume our enemies, O God,<br> Eternal, with the hottest flames.<br> 14 And, irresistible, be thou a mighty iron fort to us,<br> With hundred walls for man's defence.<br> 15 Do thou preserve us, eve and morn, from sorrow, from the wicked men,<br> Infallible! by day and night.</p>
