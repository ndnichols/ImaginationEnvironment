<TD><P>Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward   
Absalom.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray 
thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and       
anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for 
the dead:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in   
her mouth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, 
and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And 
she answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And thy handmaid had two    
sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part     
them, but the one smote the other, and slew him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And, behold, the whole family is    
risen against thine handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his         
brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we 
will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and 
shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And the king said 
unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And the woman of  
Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my    
father's house: and the king and his throne be guiltless.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And the king said, Whoever saith  
ought unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said she, I     
pray thee, let the king remember YHVH thy ELOHIYM, that thou wouldest not       
suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son.    
And he said, As YHVH liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the    
earth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Then  
the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one word unto my lord    
the king. And he said, Say on.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4> 
13</H4></TD><TD><P>And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a  
thing against the people of ELOHIYM? for the king doth speak this thing as one  
which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>For we must     
needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up    
again; neither doth ELOHIYM respect any person: yet doth he devise means, that  
his banished be not expelled from him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Now therefore that I am come to speak of this   
thing unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and  
thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will 
perform the request of his handmaid.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid 
out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the 
inheritance of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be 
comfortable: for as an angel of ELOHIYM, so is my lord the king to discern good 
and bad: therefore YHVH thy ELOHIYM will be with thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the king answered and said   
unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. 
And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And the king said, Is not the     
hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy     
soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left   
from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, 
and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>To fetch about this form of       
speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to 
the wisdom of an angel of ELOHIYM, to know all things that are in the earth.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And the king    
said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the     
young man Absalom again.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and     
thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have found   
grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the        
request of his servant.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to            
Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face.  
So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>But in all Israel there   
was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his  
foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he polled his    
head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled it: because the hair was   
heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two   
hundred shekels after the king's weight.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And unto Absalom there were born three sons,    
and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair               
countenance.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>
So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore       
Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to   
him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore he said unto    
his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and  
set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Joab arose, and came to  
Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my   
field on fire?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither,    
that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it   
had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the     
king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>So Joab came to the king, 
and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and      
bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed    
Absalom.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M.
