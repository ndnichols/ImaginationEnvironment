<TD><P>Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye    
ear, O house of the king; for judgment is toward you, because ye have been a

defiled.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>They  
will not frame their doings to turn unto their ELOHIYM: for the spirit of       
whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they have not known YHVH.</P></TD></TR>
