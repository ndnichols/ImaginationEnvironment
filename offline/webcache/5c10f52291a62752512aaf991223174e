morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowering. O ye  
hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the      
signs of the times?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall

YAHSHUA said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and

bread.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Which   
when YAHSHUA perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye  
among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?</P></TD>

said, Thou art the MASHIYACH, the Son of the living EL.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA answered and said     
unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not         
revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And I say also unto thee, That

hell shall not prevail against it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19> 
<H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of     
heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Then charged he his       
disciples that they should tell no man that he was YAHSHUA the MASHIYACH.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>From that time  
forth began YAHSHUA to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto        
Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes,  
and be killed, and be raised again the third day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Peter took him, and began to

thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>But he 
turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence     
unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of ELOHIYM, but those that   
be of men.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Then said YAHSHUA unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him    
deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>For whosoever will save his life  
shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>For what is a   
man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what  
shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his 
works.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>      
Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of    
death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
