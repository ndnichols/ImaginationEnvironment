<p>1. BRING us most mighty splendour thou, Agni, resistless on thy way.<br> With overflowing store of wealth mark out for us a path to strength.<br> 2 Ours art thou, wondrous Agni, by wisdom and bounteousness of power.<br> The might of Asuras rests on thee, like Mitra worshipful in act.<br> 3 Agni, increase our means of life, increase the house and home of these,<br> The men, the princes who have won great riches through our hymns of praise.<br> 4 Bright Agni, they who deck their songs for thee have horses as their meed.<br> The men are mighty in their might, they whose high laud, as that of heaven, awakes thee of its own accord.<br> 5 O Agni, those resplendent flames of thine go valorously forth,<br> Like lightnings flashing round us, like a rattling car that seeks the spoil.<br> 6 Now, Agni, come to succour us; let priests draw nigh to offer gifts;<br> And let the patrons of our rites subdue all regions of the earth.<br> 7 Bring to us, Agni, A&#7749;giras, lauded of old and lauded now,<br> Invoker! wealth to quell the strong, that singers may extol thee. Be near us in fight for our success.</p>
