<p>1. TO you will I sing Indra's praise who gives good gifts as well we know;<br> The praise of Maghavan who, rich in treasure, aids his singers with wealth thousandfold.<br> 2 As with a hundred hosts, he rushes boldly on, and for the offerer slays his foes.<br> As from a mountain flow the water-brooks, thus flow his gifts who feedeth many a one.<br> 3 The drops effused, the gladdening draughts, O Indra, Lover of the Son<br> As waters seek the lake where they are wont to rest, fill thee, for bounty, Thunderer.<br> 4 The matchless draught that strengthens and gives eloquence, the sweetest of the meath drink thou,<br> That in thy joy thou maysi scatter thy gifts o&#146;er us, plenteously, even as the dust.<br> 5 Come quickly to our laud, urged on by Soma-pressers like a horse-<br> Laud, Godlike Indra, which milch-kine make sweet for thee: with Ka&#7751;va's sons are gifts for thee.<br> 6 With homage have we sought thee as a Hero, strong, preeminent, with unfailing wealth.<br> O Thunderer, as a plenteous spring pours forth its stream, so, Indra, flow our songs to thee.<br> 7 If now thou art at sacrifice, or if thou art upon the earth,<br> Come thence, high-thoughted! to our sacrifice with the Swift, come, Mighty with the Mighty Ones.<br> 8 The active, fleet-foot, tawny Coursers that are thine are swift to victory, like the Wind,<br> Wherewith thou goest round to visit Manus' seed, wherewith all heaven is visible.<br> 9 Indra, from thee so great we crave prosperity in wealth of kine,<br> As, Maghavan, thou favouredst Medhy&#257;tithi, and, in the fight, Nipatithi.<br> 10 As, Maghavan, to Ka&#7751;va, Trasadasyu, and to Paktha and Dasavraja;<br> As, Indra, to Gosarya and &#7770;ji&#347;van, thou vouchsafedst wealth in kine and gold.</p>
