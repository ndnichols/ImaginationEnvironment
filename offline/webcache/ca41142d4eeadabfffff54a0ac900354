is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but   
to think soberly, according as ELOHIYM hath dealt to every man the measure of   
faith.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>For as  
we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:</P>

mercy, with cheerfulness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4>
