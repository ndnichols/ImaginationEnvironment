<p>1. SAKRA I praise, to win his aid, far-famed, exceeding bountiful,<br> Who gives, as &#146;twere in thousands, precious wealth to him who sheds the juice and worships him.<br> 2 Arrows with hundred points, unconquerable, are this Indra's n-dghty arms in war.<br> He streams on liberal worshippers like a hill with springs, when juices poured have gladdened him.<br> 3 What time the flowing Soma-drops have gladdened with their taste the Friend,<br> Like water, gracious Lord! were my libations made, like milch-kine to the worshipper.<br> 4 To him the peerless, who is calling you to give you aid, forth flow the drops of pleasant meath.<br> The Soloa-drops which call on thee, O gracious Lord, have brought thee to our hymn of praise.<br> 5 He rushes hurrying like a steed to Soma that adorns our rite,<br> Which hymns make sweet to thee, lover of pleasant food. The call to Paura thou dost love.<br> 6 Praise the strong, grasping Hero, winner of the spoil, ruling supreme oer mighty wealth.<br> Like a full spring, O Thunderer, from thy store hast thou poured on the worshipper evermore.<br> 7 Now whether thou be far away, or in the heavens, or on the earth,<br> O Indra, mighty- thoughted, harnessing thy Bays, come Lofty with the Lofty Ones.<br> 8 The Bays who draw thy chariot, Steeds who injure none, surpass the wind's impetuous strength-<br> With whom thou silencest the enemy of man, with whon; thou goest round the sky.<br> 9 O gracious Hero, may we learn anew to know thee as thou art:<br> As in decisive fight thou holpest Eta&#347;a, or Va&#347;a 'gainst Dasavraja,<br> 10 As, Maghavan, to Ka&#7751;va at the sacred feast, to Dirghanitha thine home-friend,<br> As to Gosarya thou, Stone-darter, gavest wealth, give me a gold-bright stall of kine.</p>
