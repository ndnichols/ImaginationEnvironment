<TD><P>Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of       
Samaria, which are named chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel      
came!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Pass ye  
unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great: then go down   
to Gath of the Philistines: be they better than these kingdoms? or their border 
greater than your border?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4>

to come near;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P> 
That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat 
the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall;</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>That chant to the 
sound of the viol, and invent to themselves instruments of musick, like         
David;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>That    
drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they   
are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore now shall they go captive with the   
first that go captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall  
be removed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>   
The ADONAY YHVH hath sworn by himself, saith YHVH the ELOHIYM of hosts, I abhor 
the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore will I deliver up the  
city with all that is therein.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>

him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that is by 
the sides of the house, Is there yet any with thee? and he shall say, No. Then  
shall he say, Hold thy tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of       
YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>For,

into hemlock:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not taken to us    
horns by our own strength?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>
