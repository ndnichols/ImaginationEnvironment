Pharaoh, Thus saith YHVH ELOHIYM of Israel, Let my people go, that they may     
hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And they said,    
The ELOHIYM of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three     
days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto YHVH our ELOHIYM; lest he     
fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And the king of Egypt said unto     
them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get    
you unto your burdens.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4>

taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye shall no more give the people    
straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for            
themselves.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon   
them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they     
cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Let there more work be laid upon    
the men, that they may labor therein; and let them not regard vain words.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And the

<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Go ye, get you straw where ye 
can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>So the people were scattered  
abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And the         
taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when   
there was straw.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters  
had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled   
your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the officers of

thou thus with thy servants?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>

But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and do

see that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought   
from your bricks of your daily task.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay  
us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And      
Moses returned unto the ADONAY, and said, YHVH, wherefore hast thou so evil     
entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou          
delivered thy people at all.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
