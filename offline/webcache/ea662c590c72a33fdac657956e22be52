brethren, pray for us, that the word of the ADONAY may have free course, and be 
glorified, even as it is with you:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2>  
<H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked 
men: for all men have not faith.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>

you from evil.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>
And we have confidence in the ADONAY touching you, that ye both do and will do  
the things which we command you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>

ADONAY YAHSHUA MASHIYACH, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that   
walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>For yourselves    
know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among   
you;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Neither   
did we eat any man's bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail      
night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Not because we have not power,  
but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>For we hear     
that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but    
are busybodies.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD>
<P>Now them that are such we command and exhort by our ADONAY YAHSHUA           
MASHIYACH, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>But ye, brethren, be not  
weary in well doing.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4>

and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Yet count him not as an enemy,
