<TD><P>And David spake unto YHVH the words of this song in the day that YHVH    
had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of    
Saul:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And he   
said, YHVH is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>The ELOHIYM of my rock; in him will 
I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my   
refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>I will call on YHVH, who is worthy  
to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>When the waves of death compassed   
me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the    
snares of death prevented me;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>   
7</H4></TD><TD><P>In my distress I called upon YHVH, and cried to my ELOHIYM:   
and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his       
ears.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the 
earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he 
was wroth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>    
There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured:  
coals were kindled by it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>      
10</H4></TD><TD><P>He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was   
under his feet.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of    
the wind.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and thick clouds   
of the skies.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>YHVH thundered from       
heaven, and the ELYOWN uttered his voice.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And he sent out arrows, and scattered them;     
lightning, and discomfited them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16>   
<H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of 
the world were discovered, at the rebuking of YHVH, at the blast of the breath  
of his nostrils.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>He delivered me from 
my strong enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for      
me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>They     
prevented me in the day of my calamity: but YHVH was my stay.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>He brought me forth also into 
a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>YHVH rewarded me according to 
my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed    
me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>For I    
have kept the ways of YHVH, and have not wickedly departed from my ELOHIYM.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>For all his     
judgments were before me: and as for his statutes, I did not depart from        
them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>I was  
also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore YHVH hath       
recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his  
eye sight.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>  
With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful, and with the upright man     
thou wilt show thyself upright.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>
27</H4></TD><TD><P>With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; and with the      
froward thou wilt show thyself unsavory.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but    
thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>For thou art my lamp, O   
YHVH: and YHVH will lighten my darkness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>For by thee I have run through a troop: by my   
ELOHIYM have I leaped over a wall.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31> 
<H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>As for EL, his way is perfect; the word of YHVH is       
tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>For who is EL, save YHVH? and who

33</H4></TD><TD><P>EL is my strength and power: and he maketh my way            
perfect.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>He  
maketh my feet like hinds' feet: and setteth me upon my high places.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>He teacheth my hands

VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou hast also given me the       
shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou hast enlarged my     
steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed   
them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>And I have consumed them, and     
wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>For thou hast   
girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou       
subdued under me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy

<A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou also hast delivered me from the
