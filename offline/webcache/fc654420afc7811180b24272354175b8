<p>1. WORSHIP thou J&#257;tavedas, pray to him who willingly accepts,<br> Whose smoke wanders at will, and none may grasp his flame.<br> 2 Thou, all men's friend, Visvamanas, exaltest Agni with thy song,<br> The Giver, and his flames with which no cars contend.<br> 3 Whose resolute assault, to win vigour and food, deserves our praise,&#151;<br> Through whose discovering power the priest obtaineth wealth.<br> 4 Up springs the imperishable flame, the flame of the Refulgent One<br> Most bright, with glowing jaws and glory in his train.<br> 5 Skilled in fair sacrifice, extolled, arise in Godlike loveliness,<br> Shining with lofty splendour, with effulgent light.<br> 6 Called straight to our oblations, come, O Agni, through our eulogies,<br> As thou hast been our envoy bearing up our gifts.<br> 7 I call your Agni, from of old Invoking Priest of living men:<br> Him with this song I laud and magnify for you.<br> 8 Whom, wondrous wise, they animate with solemn rites and his fair form,<br> Kind as a friend to men who keep the holy Law.<br> 9 Him, true to Law, who perfecteth the sacrifice,. Law-loving ones!<br> Ye with your song have gratified in the place of prayer.<br> 10 May all our sacrifices go to him the truest A&#7749;giras,<br> Who is among mankind the most illustrious Priest.<br> 11 Imperishable Agni, thine are all these high enkindled lights,<br> Like horses and like stallions showing forth their strength.<br> 12 So give us, Lord of Power and Might, riches combined with hero strength,<br> And guard us with our sons and grand. sons in our frays.<br> 13 Soon as the eager Lord of men is friendly unto Manti's race,<br> Agni averteth from us all the demon host.<br> 14 O Hero Agni, Lord of men, on hearing this new laud of mine,<br> Burn down the R&#257;k&#7779;asas, enchanters, with thy flame.<br> 15 No mortal foe can e&#146;er prevail by arts of magic over him<br> Who serveth Agni well with sacrificial gifts.<br> 16 Vya&#347;va the sage, who sought the Bull, hath won thee, finder of good things:<br> As such may we enkindle thee for ample wealth.<br> 17 U&#347;an&#257; K&#257;vya stablished thee, O Agni, as Invoking Priest:<br> Thee, J&#257;tavedas, Sacrificing Priest for man.<br> 18 All Deities of one accord appointed thee their messenger:<br> Thou, God, through hearing, hadst first claim to sacrifice.<br> 19 Him may the mortal hero make his own immortal messenger.<br> Far-spreading, Purifier, him whose path is black.<br> 20 With lifted ladles let us call him splendid with his brilliant flame,<br> Men's ancient Agni, wasting not, adorable.<br> 21 The man who pays the worship due to him with sacrificial gifts<br> Obtains both plenteous nourishment and hero fame.<br> 22 To J&#257;tavedas Agni, chief in sacrifices, first of all<br> With homage goes the ladle rich with sacred gifts.<br> 23 Even as Vyatya did, may we with these most high and liberal hymns<br> Pay worship unto Agni of the splendid flame.<br> 24 Now sing, as Sthurayupa sang, with lands to him who spreadeth far,<br> To Agni of the home, O &#7770;&#7779;i, Vya&#347;va's son.<br> 25 As welcome guest of human kind, as offspring of the forest kings,<br> The sages worship ancient Agni for his aid.<br> 26 For men's oblations brought to him who is the mighty Lord of all,<br> Sit, Agni, mid our homage, on the sacred grass.<br> 27 Grant us abundant. treasures, grant the opulence which many crave,<br> With store of heroes, progeny, and high renown.<br> 28 Agni, Most Youthful of the Gods, send evermore the gift of wealth<br> Unto Varosusaman and to all his folk.<br> 29 A mighty Conqueror art thou, O Agni, so disclose to us<br> Food in our herds of kine and gain of ample wealth.<br> 30 Thou, Agni, art a glorious God: bring hither Mitra, Varu&#7751;a,<br> Imperial Sovrans, holy-minded, true to Law.</p>
