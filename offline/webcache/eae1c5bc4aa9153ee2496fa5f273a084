<p>1. GREAT help ye give the worshipper, Varu&#7751;a, Mitra, Mighty Ones! No sorrow ever reaches him whom ye, &#256;dityas, keep from harm. Yours are incomparable aids, and good the succour they afford.<br> 2 O Gods, &#256;dityas, well ye know the way to keep all woes afar.<br> As the birds spread their sheltering wings, spread your protection over us.<br> 3 As the birds spread their sheltering wings let your protection cover us.<br> We mean all shelter and defence, ye who have all things for your own.<br> 4 To whomsoever they, Most Wise, have given a home and means of life,<br> O'er the whole riches of this man they, the &#256;dityas, have control.<br> 5 As drivers of the car avoid ill roads, let sorrows pass us by.<br> May we be under Indra's guard, in the &#256;dityas&#146; favouring grace.<br> 6 For verily men sink and faint through loss of wealth which ye have given.<br> Much hath he gained from you, O Gods, whom ye, &#256;dityas, have approached.<br> 7 On him shall no fierce anger fall, no sore distress shall visit him,<br> To whom, &#256;dityas, ye have lent your shelter that extendeth far.<br> 8 Resting in you, O Gods, we are like men who fight in coats of mail.<br> Ye guard us from each great offence, ye guard us from each lighter fault.<br> 9 May Aditi defend us, may Aditi guard and shelter us,<br> Mother of wealthy Mitra and of Aryaman and Varu&#7751;a.<br> 10 The shelter, Gods, that is secure, auspicious, free from malady,<br> A sure protection, triply strong, even that do ye extend to us.<br> 11 Look down on us, &#256;dityas, as a guide exploring from the bank.<br> Lead us to pleasant ways as men lead horses to an easy ford.<br> 12 Ill be it for the demons' friend to find us or come near to us.<br> But for the milch-cow be it well, and for the man who strives for fame.<br> 13 Each evil deed made manifest, and that which is concealed, O Gods,<br> The whole thereof remove from us to Trita &#256;ptya far away.<br> 14 Daughter of Heaven, the dream that bodes evil to us or to our kine,<br> Remove, O Lady of the Light, to Trita &#256;ptya far away.<br> 15 Even if, O Child of Heaven, it make a garland or a chain of gold,<br> The whole bad dream, whate&#146;er it be, to Trita &#256;ptya we consign.<br> 16 To him whose food and work is this, who comes to take his share therein,<br> To Trita, and to Dvita, Dawn! bear thou the evil dream away.<br> 17 As we collect the utmost debt, even the eighth and sixteenth part,<br> So unto &#256;ptya we transfer together all the evil dream.<br> 18 Now have we conquered and obtained, and from our trespasses are free.<br> Shine thou away the evil dream, O Dawn, whereof we are afraid. Yours are incomparable aids, and good the succour they afford.</p>
