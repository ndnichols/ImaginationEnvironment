<p>1. THE Maruts of resistless might who love the rain, resplendent, terrible like wild beasts in their strength,<br> Glowing like flames of fire, impetuous in career, blowing the wandering rain-cloud, have disclosed the kine.<br> 2 They gleam with armlets as the heavens are decked with stars, like cloud-born lightnings shine the torrents of their rain.<br> Since the strong Rudra, O Maruts with brilliant chests, sprang into life for you in P&#7771;&#347;ni's radiant lap.<br> 3 They drip like horses in the racings of swift steeds; with the stream's rapid cars they hasten on their way.<br> Maruts with helms of gold, ye who make all things shake, <A HREF="errata.htm#12">come</A> with your spotted deer, one-minded, to our food.<br> 4 They have bestowed of Mitra all that live, to feed, they who for evermore cause their swift drops to flow;<br> Whose steeds are spotted deer, whose riches never fail, like horses in full speed, bound to the pole in work.<br> 5 With brightly-flaming kine whose udders swell with milk, with glittering lances on your unobstructed paths,<br> O Maruts, of one mind, like swans who seek their nests, come to the rapturous enjoyment of the meath.<br> 6 To these our prayers, O Maruts, come unanimous, come ye to our libations like the praise of men.<br> Make it swell like a mare, in udder like a cow, and for the singer grace the song with plenteous strength.<br> 7 Give us a steed, O Maruts mighty in the car; prevailing prayer that brings remembrance day by day;<br> Food to your praisers, to your bard in deeds of might give winning wisdom, power uninjured, unsurpassed.<br> 8 When the bright-chested Maruts, lavish of their gifts, bind at the time bliss their horses to the cars,<br> Then, as the milch-cow feeds her calf within the stalls, they pour forth food for all oblation-bringing men.<br> 9 Save us, O Maruts, Vasus, from the injurer, the mortal foe who makes us looked upon as wolves.<br> With chariot all aflame compass him round about: O Rudras, cast away the foeman's deadly bolt.<br> 10 Well-known, ye Maruts, is that wondrous course of yours, when they milked P&#7771;&#347;ni's udder, close akin to her.<br> Or when to shame the bard who lauded, Rudra's Sons, ye O infallible brought Trita to decay.<br> 11 We call you such, great Maruts, following wonted ways, to the oblation paid to Vi&#7779;&#7751;u Speeder-on.<br> With ladles lifted up, with prayer, we seek of them preeminent, golden-hued, the wealth which all extol.<br> 12 They, the Da&#347;agvas, first of all brought sacrifice: they at the break of mornings shall inspirit us.<br> Dawn with her purple beams uncovereth the nights, with great light glowing like a billowy sea of milk.<br> 13 The Rudras have rejoiced them in the gathered bands at seats of worship as in purple ornaments.<br> They with impetuous vigour sending down the rain have taken to themselves a bright and lovely hue.<br> 14 Soliciting their high protection for our help, with this our adoration we sing praise to them,<br> Whom, for assistance, like the five terrestrial priests. Trita hath brought to aid us hither on his car.<br> 15 So may your favouring help be turned to us-ward, your kindness like a lowing cow approach us,<br> Wherewith ye bear your servant over trouble, and free your worshipper from scoff and scorning.</p>
