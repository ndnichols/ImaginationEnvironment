<p>1. LET these speak loudly forth; let us speak out aloud: to the loud speaking Pressing-stones address the speech;<br> When, rich with Soma juice, Stones of the mountain, ye, united, swift to Indra bring the sound of praise.<br> 2 They speak out like a hundred, like a thousand men: they cry aloud to us with their green-tinted mouths,<br> While, pious Stones, they ply their task with piety, and, even before the Hotar, taste the offered food.<br> 3 Loudly they speak, for they have found the savoury meath: they make a humming sound over the meat prepared.<br> As they devour the branch of the Red-coloured Tree, these, the well-pastured Bulls, have uttered bellowings.<br> 4 They cry aloud, with strong exhilarating drink, calling on Indra now, for they have found the meath.<br> Bold, with the sisters they have danced, embraced by them, making the earth reecho with their ringing sound.<br> 5 The Eagles have sent forth their cry aloft in heaven; in the sky's vault the dark impetuous ones have danced.<br> Then downward to the nether stone's fixt place they sink, and, splendid as the Sun, effuse their copious stream.<br> 6 Like strong ones drawing, they have put forth all their strength: the Bulls, harnessed together, bear the chariot-poles.<br> When they have bellowed, panting, swallowing their food, the sound of their loud snorting is like that of steeds.<br> 7 To these who have ten workers and a tenfold girth, to these who have ten yoke-straps and ten binding thongs,<br> To these who bear ten reins, the eternal, sing ye praise, to these who bear ten car-poles, ten when they are yoked.<br> 8 These Stones with ten conductors, rapid in their course, with lovely revolution travel round and round.<br> They have been first to drink the flowing Soma juice, first to enjoy the milky fluid of the stalk.<br> 9 These Soma-eaters kiss Indra's Bay-coloured Steeds: draining. the stalk they sit upon the ox's hide.<br> Indra, when he hath drunk Soma-meath drawn by them, waxes in strength, is famed, is mighty as a Bull.<br> 10. Strong is your stalk; ye, verily, never shall be harmed; ye have refreshment, ye are ever satisfied.<br> Fair are ye, as it were, through splendour of his wealth, his in whose sacrifice, O Stones, ye find delight.<br> 11 Bored deep, but not pierced through with holes, are ye, O Stones, not loosened, never weary, and exempt from death,<br> Eternal, undiseased, moving in sundry ways, unthirsting, full of fatness, void of all desire.<br> 12 Your fathers, verily, stand firm from age to age: they, loving rest, are not dissevered from their seat.<br> Untouched by time, ne&#146;er lacking green plants and green trees, they with their voice have caused the heavens and earth to hear.<br> 13 This, this the Stones proclaim, what time they are disjoined, and when with ringing sounds they move and drink the balm.<br> Like tillers of the ground when they are sowing seed, they mix the Soma, nor, devouring, minish it.<br> 14 They have raised high their voice for juice, for sacrifice, striking the Mother earth as though they danced thereon.<br> So loose thou too his thought who hath effused the sap, and let the Stones which we are honouring be disjoined.</p>
