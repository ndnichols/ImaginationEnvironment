</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>It is reported    
commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so 
much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And ye are puffed 
up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be      
taken away from among you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4>
</TD><TD><P>For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged 
already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this        
deed,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>In the   
name of our ADONAY YAHSHUA MASHIYACH, when ye are gathered together, and my     
spirit, with the power of our ADONAY YAHSHUA MASHIYACH,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>To deliver such an one unto Satan   
for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of    
the ADONAY YAHSHUA.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth    
the whole lump?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are     
unleavened. For even MASHIYACH our passover is sacrificed for us:</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore let us keep the   
feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness;   
but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>I wrote unto you in an epistle not  
to company with fornicators:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>   
10</H4></TD><TD><P>Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or    
with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs   
go out of the world.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man     
that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a     
railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>For what have I 
to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are        
within?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>But  
them that are without ELOHIYM judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves 
that wicked person.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by
