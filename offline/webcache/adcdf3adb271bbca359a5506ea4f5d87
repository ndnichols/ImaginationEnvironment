<TD><P>In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first

this house lie waste?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Now therefore thus saith YHVH of hosts; Consider your ways.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye have sown much, and      
bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not       
filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth   
wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the  
corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground   
bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the   
hands.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Then  
Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high

ELOHIYM, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as YHVH their ELOHIYM had sent    
him, and the people did fear before YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A
