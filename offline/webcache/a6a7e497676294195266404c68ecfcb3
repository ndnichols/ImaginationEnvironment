And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose 
a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were      
neglected in the daily ministration.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2>
<H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples     
unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of ELOHIYM, 
and serve tables.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD>
<P>Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full  
of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>But we will give       
ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And the saying pleased the  
whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy    
Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and     
Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>

they laid their hands on them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>  
7</H4></TD><TD><P>And the word of ELOHIYM increased; and the number of the      
disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests   
were obedient to the faith.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>

miracles among the people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the      
synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of    
Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought 
him to the council,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak    
blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD
