<p>1. FATHER of Maruts, let thy bliss approach us: exclude us not from looking on the sunlight.<br> Gracious to our fleet courser be the Hero may we transplant us, Rudra, in our children.<br> 2 With the most saving medicines which thou givest, Rudra, may I attain a hundred winters.<br> Far from us banish enmity and hatred, and to all quarters maladies and trouble.<br> 3 Chief of all born art thou in glory, Rudra, armed with the thunder, mightiest of the mighty.<br> Transport us over trouble to well-being repel thou from us all assaults of mischief.<br> 4 Let us not anger thee with worship, Rudra, ill praise, Strong God! or mingled invocation.<br> Do thou with strengthening balms incite our heroes: I hear thee famed as best of all physicians.<br> 5 May I with praise-songs win that Rudra's favour who is adored with gifts and invocations.<br> Ne&#146;er may the tawny God, fair-checked, and gracious, swifthearing, yield us to this evil purpose.<br> 6 The Strong, begirt by Maruts, hath refreshed me, with most invigorating food, imploring.<br> As he who finds a shade in fervent sunlight may I, uninjured, win the bliss of Rudra.<br> 7 Where is that gracious hand of thine, O Rudra, the hand that giveth health and bringeth comfort,<br> Remover of the woe that Gods have sent us? O Strong One, look thou on me with compassion.<br> 8 To him the strong, great, tawny, fair-complexioned, I utter forth a mighty hymn of praises.<br> We serve the brilliant God with adorations, we glorify, the splendid name of Rudra.<br> 9 With firm limbs, multiform, the strong, the tawny adorns himself with bright gold decorations:<br> The strength of Godhead ne&#146;er departs from Rudra, him who is Sovran of this world, the mighty.<br> 10 Worthy, thou carriest thy bow and arrows, worthy, thy manyhued and honoured necklace.<br> Worthy, thou cuttest here each fiend to pieces: a mightier than thou there is not, Rudra.<br> 11 Praise him the chariot-borne, the young, the famous, fierce, slaying like a dread beast of the forest.<br> O Rudra, praised, be gracious to the singer. let thy hosts spare us and smite down another.<br> 12 I bend to thee as thou approachest, Rudra, even as a boy before the sire who greets him.<br> I praise thee Bounteous Giver, Lord of heroes: give medicines to us as thou art lauded.<br> 13 Of your pure medicines, O potent Maruts, those that are wholesomest and health-bestowing,<br> Those which our father Manu hath selected, I crave from. Rudra for our gain and welfare.<br> 14 May Rudra's missile turn aside and spare us, the great wrath of the impetuous One avoid us.<br> Turn, Bounteous God, thy strong bow from our princes, and be thou gracious to our seed and offspring.<br> 15 O tawny Bull, thus showing forth thy nature, as neither to be wroth, O God, nor slay us.<br> Here, Rudra, listen to our invocation. Loud may we speak, with heroes, in assembly.</p>
