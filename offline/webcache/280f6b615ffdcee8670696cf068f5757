<p>1. Go hence, O Death, pursue thy special pathway apart from that which Gods are wont to travel.<br> To thee I say it who hast eyes and hearest: Touch not our offspring, injure not our heroes.<br> 2 As ye have come effacing Mrtyu's footstep, to further times prolonging your existence,<br> May ye be rich in children and possessions. cleansed, purified, and meet for sacrificing.<br> 3 Divided from the dead are these, the living: now be our calling on the Gods successful.<br> We have gone forth for dancing and for laughter, tofurther times prolonging our existence.<br> 4 Here I erect this rampart for the living; let none of these, none other, reach this limit.<br> May they survive a hundred lengthened autumns, and may they bury Death beneath this mountain.<br> 5 As the days follow days in close succession, as with the seasons duly come the seasons,<br> As each successor fails not his foregoer, so form the lives of these, O great Ordainer.<br> 6 Live your full lives ap! find old age delightful, all of you striving one behind the other.<br> May Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar, maker of fair things, be gracious and lengthen out the days of your existence.<br> 7 Let these unwidowed dames with noble husbands adorn themselves with fragrant balm and unguent.<br> Decked with fair jewels, tearless, free from sorrow, first let the dames go up to where he lieth.<br> 8 Rise, come unto the world of life, O woman: come, he is lifeless by whose side thou liest.<br> Wifehood with this thy husband was thy portion, who took thy hand and wooed thee as a lover.<br> 9 From his dead hand I take the bow be carried, that it may be our power and might and glory.<br> There art thou, there; and here with noble heroes may we o&#146;ercome all hosts that fight against us.<br> 10 Betake thee to the Iap of Earth the Mother, of Earth far-spreading, very kind and gracious.<br> Young Dame, wool-soft unto the guerdongiver, may she preserve thee from Destruction's bosom.<br> 11 Heave thyself, Earth, nor press thee downward heavily: afford him easy access, gently tending him.<br> Cover him, as a mother wraps her skirt about her child, O Earth.<br> 12 Now let the heaving earth be free from motion: yea,&#151;let a thousand clods remain above him.<br> Be they to him a home distilling fatness, here let them ever be his place of refuge.<br> 13 I stay the earth from thee, while over thee I place this piece of earth. May I be free from injury.<br> Here let the Fathers keep this pillar firm for thee, and there let Yama make thee an abiding-place.<br> 14 Even as an arrow's feathers, they have set me on a fitting day.<br> The fit word have I caught and held as &#146;twere a courser with the rein.</p>
