1</H4></TD><TD><P>Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to ELOHIYM for Israel  
is, that they might be saved.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>   
2</H4></TD><TD><P>For I bear them record that they have a zeal of ELOHIYM, but  
not according to knowledge.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>     
3</H4></TD><TD><P>For they being ignorant of ELOHIYM's righteousness, and going 
about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto  
the righteousness of EL.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>For MASHIYACH is the end of the law for righteousness to every one  
that believeth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man     
which doeth those things shall live by them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh  
on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is,   
to bring MASHIYACH down from above:)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7>
<H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring   
up MASHIYACH again from the dead.)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8>  
<H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy     
mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>That if thou shalt     
confess with thy mouth the ADONAY YAHSHUA, and shalt believe in thine heart     
that YHVH hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>For with the heart man        
believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto        
salvation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>  
For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>For there is no 
difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same YHVH over all is rich    
unto all that call upon him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>   
13</H4></TD><TD><P>For whosoever shall call upon the name of YHVH shall be      
saved.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>How   
then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they  
believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a   
preacher?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful 
are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of 
good things!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>
But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, YHVH, who hath       
believed our report?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of         
YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>But I  
say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and  
their words unto the ends of the world.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses     
saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a      
foolish nation I will anger you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20>   
<H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them  
that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>But to Israel   
he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and   
gainsaying people.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by
