1</H4></TD><TD><P>At that time YAHSHUA went on the sabbath day through the      
corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn    
and to eat.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>   
But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do     
that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>But he said unto them, Have ye not  
read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him;</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>How he entered    
into the house of ELOHIYM, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for  
him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests?</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Or have ye not    
read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane 
the sabbath, and are blameless?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4> 
6</H4></TD><TD><P>But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than    
the temple.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>   
But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye 
would not have condemned the guiltless.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And when  
he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal   
on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, What man

on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>How much then is a man    
better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.</P>

to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was     
restored whole, like as the other.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14> 
<H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against  
him, how they might destroy him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15>   
<H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>But when YAHSHUA knew it, he withdrew himself from       
thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And charged them that     
they should not make him known:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>
17</H4></TD><TD><P>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the    
prophet, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is    
well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the  
Gentiles.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>He 
shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Then was brought unto him 
one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that   
the blind and dumb both spake and saw.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

not this the son of David?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>     
24</H4></TD><TD><P>But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth 
not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA knew their    
thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought   
to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not         
stand:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his      
kingdom stand?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them    
out? therefore they shall be your judges.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he    
will spoil his house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not     
with me scattereth abroad.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>     
31</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy    
shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not  
be forgiven unto men.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be   
forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be    
forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>Either make the tree      
good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: 
for the tree is known by his fruit.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34>
<H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak    
good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>A good man out of    
the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out  
of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>But I say unto you, That every    
idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of   
judgment.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>   
For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be        
condemned.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we   
would see a sign from thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>    
39</H4></TD><TD><P>But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous   
generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but    
the sign of the prophet Jonas:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4> 
40</H4></TD><TD><P>For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's  
belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of   
the earth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>  
The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall       
condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a     
greater than Jonas is here.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>    
42</H4></TD><TD><P>The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with    
this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of 
the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is 
here.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>When   
the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking 
rest, and findeth none.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out;  
and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P>Then goeth he, and taketh 
with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in    
and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even   
so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46><H4>46</H4></TD><TD><P>While he yet talked to the        
people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak    
with him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>47</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without,      
desiring to speak with thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V48><H4>   
48</H4></TD><TD><P>But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my   
mother? and who are my brethren?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V49>   
<H4>49</H4></TD><TD><P>And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples,

which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.</P></TD>
