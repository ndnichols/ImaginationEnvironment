<TD><P>For, behold, the ADOWN, YHVH of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and 
from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay  
of water.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>The  
mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent,    
and the ancient,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor, and the    
cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will give children to be their princes, and 
babes shall rule over them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>     
5</H4></TD><TD><P>And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and  
every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the  
ancient, and the base against the honourable.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>When a man shall take hold of his brother of   
the house of his father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let 
this ruin be under thy hand:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>

for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the       
people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>For    
Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings

As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my

paths.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>YHVH

VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>YHVH will enter into judgment     
with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up  
the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

making a tinkling with their feet:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17>
