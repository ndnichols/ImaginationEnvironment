<TD><P>And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him,   
Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA answering said unto 
him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon   
another, that shall not be thrown down.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over       
against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Tell us, when     
shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall   
be fulfilled?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And YAHSHUA answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive you:</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>For many shall    
come in my name, saying, I am MASHIYACH; and shall deceive many.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And when ye shall hear of   
wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be;    
but the end shall not be yet.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>   
8</H4></TD><TD><P>For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against     
kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be    
famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>But take heed to yourselves: for    
they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be        
beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a      
testimony against them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And the gospel must first be published among all nations.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>But when they shall  
lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak,   
neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that 
speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Now the brother shall betray the  
brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against    
their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And ye shall be hated of all men  
for my name's sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be    
saved.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>But   
when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the        
prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then   
let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And let him that is on the        
housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing   
out of his house:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his  
garment.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>But 
woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And pray ye     
that your flight be not in the winter.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>For in those days shall be affliction, such as  
was not from the beginning of the creation which ELOHIYM created unto this      
time, neither shall be.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And except that YHVH had shortened those days, no flesh should be   
saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the     
days.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is MASHIYACH; or, lo, he is there;   
believe him not:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>For false MASHIYACHs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs 
and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>But take ye heed: behold, I   
have foretold you all things.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>  
24</H4></TD><TD><P>But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be  
darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And the stars of heaven shall     
fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And then shall they see the Son   
of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And then shall he send his        
angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the       
uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Now learn a parable of the    
fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that 
summer is near:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD>
<P>So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that 
it is nigh, even at the doors.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4> 
30</H4></TD><TD><P>Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass,  
till all these things be done.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4> 
31</H4></TD><TD><P>Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not     
pass away.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>  
But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in   
heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not   
when the time is.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, 
and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded    
the porter to watch.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house    
cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>Lest coming     
suddenly he find you sleeping.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4> 
37</H4></TD><TD><P>And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.</P></TD></TR>
