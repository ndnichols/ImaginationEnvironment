<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>Now it came to pass, as David   
sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an      
house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of YHVH remaineth under            
curtains.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Then 
Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for ELOHIYM is with      
thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And it   
came to pass the same night, that the word of ELOHIYM came to Nathan,           
saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Go and 
tell David my servant, Thus saith YHVH, Thou shalt not build me an house to     
dwell in:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>For  
I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this   
day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Wheresoever I     
have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel,     
whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house   
of cedars?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Now 
therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith YHVH of hosts,  
I took thee from the sheepcote, even from following the sheep, that thou        
shouldest be ruler over my people Israel:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast 
walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee 
a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Also I will ordain a place for  
my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and 
shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any 
more, as at the beginning,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>     
10</H4></TD><TD><P>And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my     
people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell     
thee that YHVH will build thee an house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And it shall come to pass, when thy days be     
expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed 
after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>He shall build  
me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>I will be his father, and he      
shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from  
him that was before thee:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>      
14</H4></TD><TD><P>But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for    
ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>According to all these words, and 
according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And David the king came and   
sat before YHVH, and said, Who am I, O YHVH ELOHIYM, and what is mine house,    
that thou hast brought me hitherto?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17>
<H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O ELOHIYM; 
for thou hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and 
hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O YHVH        
ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>    
What can David speak more to thee for the honor of thy servant? for thou        
knowest thy servant.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>O YHVH, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart,   
hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these great things.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>O YHVH, there   
is none like thee, neither is there any ELOHIYM beside thee, according to all   
that we have heard with our ears.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21>  
<H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And what one nation in the earth is like thy people      
Israel, whom ELOHIYM went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name   
of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people    
whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own 
people for ever; and thou, YHVH, becamest their ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore now, YHVH, let the      
thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be  
established for ever, and do as thou hast said.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Let it even be established, that thy name    
may be magnified for ever, saying, YHVH of hosts is the ELOHIYM of Israel, even 
a ELOHIYM to Israel: and let the house of David thy servant be established      
before thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>
For thou, O my ELOHIYM, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an       
house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And now, YHVH,  
thou art ELOHIYM, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>Now therefore let it 
please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for   
ever: for thou blessest, O YHVH, and it shall be blessed for ever.</P></TD></TR>
