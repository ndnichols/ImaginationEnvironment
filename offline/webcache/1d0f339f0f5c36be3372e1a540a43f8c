<TD><P>And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of   
the Gadarenes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>
And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the      
tombs a man with an unclean spirit,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3> 
<H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could    
bind him, no, not with chains:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>  
4</H4></TD><TD><P>Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, 
and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in       
pieces: neither could any man tame him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And always, night and day, he was in the          
mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>But when he saw        
YAHSHUA afar off, he ran and worshipped him,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have  
I to do with thee, YAHSHUA, thou Son of the ELYOWN EL? I adjure thee by         
ELOHIYM, that thou torment me not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8>  
<H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean   
spirit.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And he 
asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we 
are many.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the            
country.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Now 
there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And all the devils   
besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And forthwith   
YAHSHUA gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the 
swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were   
about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And they that fed the swine fled, 
and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it   
was that was done.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And they come to YAHSHUA, and see him that was possessed with the devil, 
and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were  
afraid.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the     
devil, and also concerning the swine.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And they began to pray him to depart out of     
their coasts.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the      
devil prayed him that he might be with him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Howbeit YAHSHUA suffered him not, but saith     
unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things YHVH hath done 
for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And he departed, and began to publish in        
Decapolis how great things YAHSHUA had done for him: and all men did marvel.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And when        
YAHSHUA was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered 
unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of  
the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And besought    
him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray     
thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall      
live.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
YAHSHUA went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And a certain woman, 
which had an issue of blood twelve years,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And had suffered many things of many            
physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but       
rather grew worse,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>When she had heard of YAHSHUA, came in the press behind, and touched his 
garment.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>For 
she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And straightway the fountain  
of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that 
plague.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
YAHSHUA, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned 
him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And his disciples said unto him,  
Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And he looked   
round about to see her that had done this thing.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>But the woman fearing and         
trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and     
told him all the truth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go  
in peace, and be whole of thy plague.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>While he yet spake, there came from the ruler   
of the synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why          
troublest thou the Master any further?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>As soon as YAHSHUA heard the word that was      
spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only           
believe.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother   
of James.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, 
and them that wept and wailed greatly.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he was come in, he saith unto them,    
Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>And they laughed him 
to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother 
of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel    
was lying.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is,  
being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>And straightway the damsel arose, 
and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished    
with a great astonishment.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>     
43</H4></TD><TD><P>And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and 
commanded that something should be given her to eat.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
