<p>1. PRIESTS, offer to the Lord of all the people the milked-out stalk of Soma, radiant-coloured.<br> No wild-bull knows his drinking-place like Indra who ever seeks him who hath pressed the Soma,<br> 2 Thou dost desire to drink, each day that passes, the pleasant food which thou hast had aforetime,<br> O Indra, gratified in heart and spirit, drink eagerly the Soma set before thee.<br> 3 Thou, newly-born, for strength didst drink the Soma; the Mother told thee of thy future greatness.<br> O Indra, thou hast filled mid-air's wide region, and given the Gods by battle room and freedom.<br> 4 When thou hast urged the arrocrant to combat, proud in their strength of arm, we will subdue them.<br> Or, Indra, when thou fightest girt by heroes, we in the glorious fray with thee will conquer.<br> 5 I will declare the earliest deeds of Indra, and recent acts which Maghavan hath accomplished.<br> When he had conquered godless wiles and magic, Soma became his own entire possession.<br> 6 Thine is this world of flocks and herds around thee, which with the eye of S&#363;rya thou beholdest.<br> Thou, Indra, art alone the Lord of cattle; may we enjoy the treasure which thou givest.<br> 7 Ye Twain are Lords of wealth in earth and heaven, thou, O B&#7771;haspati, and thou, O Indra.<br> Mean though he be, give wealth to him who lauds you. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
