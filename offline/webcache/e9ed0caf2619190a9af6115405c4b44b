answered YHVH, and said,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be   
withholden from thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I        
uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew        
not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Hear, I   
beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto    
me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>I have     
heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore I abhor      
myself, and repent in dust and ashes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And it was so, that after YHVH had spoken these   
words unto Job, YHVH said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against  
thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that  
is right, as my servant Job hath.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8>   
<H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven      
rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering;   
and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with  
you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is       
right, like my servant Job.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>     
9</H4></TD><TD><P>So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the 
Naamathite went, and did according as YHVH commanded them: YHVH also accepted   
Job.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And     
YHVH turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also YHVH     
gave Job twice as much as he had before.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Then came there unto him all his brethren, and  
all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did 
eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over  
all the evil that YHVH had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of 
money, and every one an earring of gold.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>So YHVH blessed the latter end of Job more than 
his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and 
a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>He had also seven sons and three  
daughters.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; 
and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And in all the land were no women found so fair 
as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their     
brethren.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>   
After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his      
sons' sons, even four generations.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17> 
<H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>So Job died, being old and full of days.</P></TD></TR>
