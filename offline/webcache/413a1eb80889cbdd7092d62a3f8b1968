<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>When YHVH thy ELOHIYM hath cut  
off the nations, whose land YHVH thy ELOHIYM giveth thee, and thou succeedest   
them, and dwellest in their cities, and in their houses;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou shalt separate three cities    
for thee in the midst of thy land, which YHVH thy ELOHIYM giveth thee to        
possess it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy land, which YHVH    
thy ELOHIYM giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every slayer may     
flee thither.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And this is the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither, that he may live: 
Whoso killeth his neighbor ignorantly, whom he hated not in time past;</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>As when a man goeth    
into the wood with his neighbor to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke     
with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and    
lighteth upon his neighbor, that he die; he shall flee unto one of those        
cities, and live:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD>
<P>Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and 
overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he was not worthy  
of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore I command thee, saying,   
Thou shalt separate three cities for thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to    
give unto thy fathers;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I       
command thee this day, to love YHVH thy ELOHIYM, and to walk ever in his ways;  
then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, beside these three:</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>That innocent blood  
be not shed in thy land, which YHVH thy ELOHIYM giveth thee for an inheritance, 
and so blood be upon thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>

one of these cities:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and    
deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.</P></TD>

of old time have set in thine inheritance,
 which thou shalt inherit in the    
land that YHVH thy ELOHIYM giveth thee to
 possess it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the       
matter be established.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4>

days;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And
