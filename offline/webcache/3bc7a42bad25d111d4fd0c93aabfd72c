<p>1. HEAR thou my call, O Indra; be not heedless: thine may we be for thee to give us treasures;<br> For these presented viands, seeking riches, increase thy strength like streams of water flowing.<br> 2 Floods great and many, compassed by the Dragon, thou badest swell and settest free, O Hero.<br> Strengthened by songs of praise thou rentest piecemeal the D&#257;sa, him who deemed himself immortal.<br> 3 For, Hero, in the lauds wherein thou joyedst, in hymns of praise, O Indra, songs of Rudras,<br> These streams in which is thy delight approach thee, even as the brilliant ones draw near to V&#257;yu.<br> 4 We who add strength to thine own splendid vigour, laying within thine arms the splendid thunder&#151;<br> With us mayst thou, O Indra, waxen splendid, with S&#363;rya overcome the D&#257;sa races.<br> 5 Hero, thou slewest in thy valour Ahi concealed in depths, mysterious, great enchanter,<br> Dwelling enveloped deep within the waters, him who checked heaven and stayed the floods from flowing.<br> 6 Indra, we laud thy great deeds wrought aforetime, we laud thine exploits later of achievement;<br> We laud the bolt that in thine arms lies eager; we laud thy two Bay Steeds, heralds of S&#363;rya.<br> 7 Indra, thy Bay Steeds showing forth their vigour have sent a loud cry out that droppeth fatness.<br> The earth hath spread herself in all her fulness: the cloud that was about to move hath rested.<br> 8 Down, never ceasing, hath the rain-cloud settled: bellowing, it hath wandered with the Mothers.<br> Swelling the roar in the far distant limits, they have spread wide the blast sent forth by Indra.<br> 9 Indra hath hurled down the magician V&#7771;tra who lay beleaguering the mighty river.<br> Then both the heaven and earth trembled in terror at the strong Hero's thunder when he bellowed.<br> 10 Loud roared the mighty Hero's bolt of thunder, when he, the Friend of man, burnt up the monster,<br> And, having drunk his fill of flowing Soma, baffled the guileful D&#257;nava's devices.<br> 11 Drink thou, O Hero Indra, drink the Soma; let the joy-giving juices make thee joyful.<br> They, filling both thy flanks, shall swell thy vigour. The juice that satisfies hath helped Indra.<br> 12 Singers have we become with thee, O Indra: may we serve duly and prepare devotion.<br> Seeking thy help we meditate thy praises: may we at once enjoy thy gift of riches.<br> 13 May we be thine, such by thy help, O Indra, as swell thy vigour while they seek thy favour.<br> Give us, thou God, the riches that we long for, most powerful, with stare of noble children.<br> 14 Give us a friend, give us an habitation; Indra, give us the company of Maruts,<br> And those whose minds accord with theirs, the V&#257;yus, who drink the first libation of the Soma.<br> 15 Let those enjoy in whom thou art delighted. Indra, drink Soma for thy strength and gladness.<br> Thou hast exalted us to heaven, Preserver, in battles, through the lofty hymns that praise thee.<br> 16 Great, verily, are they, O thou Protector, who by their songs of praise have won the blessing.<br> They who strew sacred grass to be thy dwelling, helped by thee have got them strength, O Indra.<br> 17 Upon the great Trikadruka days, Hero, rejoicing thee, O Indra, drink the Soma.<br> Come with Bay Steeds to drink of libation, shaking the drops from out thy beard, contented.<br> 18 Hero, assume the might wherewith thou clavest V&#7771;tra piecemeal, the D&#257;nava Aur&#7751;av&#257;bha.<br> Thou hast disclosed the light to light the &#256;rya: on thy left hand, O Indra, sank the Dasyu.<br> 19 May we gain wealth, subduing with thy succour and with the &#256;rya, all our foes, the Dasyus.<br> Our gain was that to T&#7771;ta of our party thou gavest up Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar's son Vi&#347;var&#363;pa.<br> 20 He cast down Arbuda what time his vigour was strengthened by libations poured by T&#7771;ta.<br> Indra sent forth his whirling wheel like S&#363;rya, and aided by the A&#7749;girases rent Vala.<br> 21 Now let that wealthy Cow of thine, O Indra, yield in return a boon to him who lauds thee.<br> Give to thy praisers: let not fortune fail us. Loud may we speak, with brave men, in the assembly.</p>
