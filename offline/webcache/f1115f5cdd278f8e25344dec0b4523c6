<p>1. To make this Varu&#7751;a come forth sing thou a song unto the band of Maruts wiser than thyself,&#151;<br> This Varu&#7751;a who guardeth well the thoughts of men like herds of kine.<br> Let all the others die away.<br> 2 Him altogether praise I with the song and hymns our fathers sang, and with Nabh&#257;ka's eulogies,&#151;<br> Him dwelling at the rivers&#146; source, surrounded by his Sisters Seven.<br> 3 The nights he hath encompassed, and stablished the morns with magic art visible over all is he.<br> His dear Ones, following his Law, have prospered the Three Dawns for him.<br> 4 He, visible o&#146;er all the earth, stablished the quarters of the sky:<br> He measured out the eastern place, that is the fold of Varu&#7751;a: like a strong herdsman is the God.<br> 5 He who supports the worlds of life, he who well knows the hidden names mysterious of the morning beams,<br> He cherishes much wisdom, Sage, as heaven brings forth each varied form.<br> 6 In whom all wisdom centres, as the nave is set within the wheel.<br> Haste ye to honour Trita, as kine haste to gather in the fold, even as they muster steeds to yoke.<br> 7 He wraps these regions as a robe; he contemplates the tribes of Gods and all the works of mortal men.<br> Before the home of Varu&#7751;a all the Gods follow his decree.<br> 8 He is an Ocean far-removed, yet through the heaven to him ascends the worship which these realms possess.<br> With his bright foot he overthrew their magic, and went up to heaven.<br> 9 Ruler, whose bright far-seeing rays, pervading all three earths, have filled the three superior realms of heaven.<br> Firm is the seat of Varu&#7751;a: over the Seven he rules as King.<br> 10 Who, after his decree, o&#146;erspread the Dark Ones with a robe of light;<br> Who measured out the ancient seat, who pillared both the worlds apart as the Unborn supported heaven. Let all the others die away.</p>
