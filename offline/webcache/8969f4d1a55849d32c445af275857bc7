<TD><P>Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and   
drank wine before the thousand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4> 
2</H4></TD><TD><P>Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the 
golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the  
temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and   
his concubines, might drink therein.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3>
<H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out  
of the temple of the house of ELAHH which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and   
his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>They drank wine, and praised the    
gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>In the same hour came  
forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the  
plaister of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the     
hand that wrote.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so   
that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against       
another.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>The   
king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the            
soothsayers. And the king spake, and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever 
shall read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be       
clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the 
third ruler in the kingdom.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>     
8</H4></TD><TD><P>Then came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read 
the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Then was king          
Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his    
lords were astonied.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came 
into the banquet house: and the queen spake and said, O king, live for ever:    
let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed:</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>There is a man in    
thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy     
father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was     
found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy     
father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and               
soothsayers;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>
Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding,             
interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of        
doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now    
let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Then was Daniel brought in before 
the king. And the king spake and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which  
art of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought  
out of Jewry?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that  
light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And now the wise men, the     
astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this         
writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not  
shew the interpretation of the thing:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make  
interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and   
make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with         
scarlet, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler  
in the kingdom.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD>
<P>Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself,  
and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing unto the king, and 
make known to him the interpretation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>O thou king, the ELYOWN ELAHH gave              
Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour:</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And for the     
majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and      
feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and  
whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>But when his heart was lifted up, 
and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they 
took his glory from him:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like 
the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they fed him with grass   
like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the   
ELYOWN ELAHH ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it        
whomsoever he will.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though     
thou knewest all this;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>But hast lifted up thyself against the MARE of heaven; and they     
have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy 
wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the   
gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor   
hear, nor know: and the ELAHH in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all    
thy ways, hast thou not glorified:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24> 
<H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this    
writing was written.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL,        
UPHARSIN.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>   
This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; ELAHH hath numbered thy kingdom, 
and finished it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>PERES; Thy kingdom   
is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Then commanded Belshazzar, and    
they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and   
made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the    
kingdom.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>In  
that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And Darius the Median took the    
kingdom, being about threescore and two years old.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
