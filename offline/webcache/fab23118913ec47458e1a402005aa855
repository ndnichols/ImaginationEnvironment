<p>1. HERE is one light for thee, another yonder: enter the third and he therewith united.<br> Uniting with a body be thou welcome, dear to the Gods in their sublimest birthplace.<br> 2 Bearing thy body, Vajin, may thy body afford us blessing and thyself protection.<br> Unswerving, stablish as it were in heaven thine own light as the mighty God's supporter.<br> 3 Strong Steed art thou: go to the yearning Maidens with vigour, happily go to heaven and praises:<br> Fly happily to the Gods with easy passage, according to the first and faithful statutes.<br> 4 Part of their grandeur have the Fathers also gained: the Gods have seated mental power in them as Gods.<br> They have embraced within themselves all energies, which, issuing forth, again into their bodies pass.<br> 5 They strode through all the region with victorious might, establishing the old immeasurable laws.<br> They compassed in their bodies all existing things, and streamed forth offipring in many successive forms.<br> 6 In two ways have the sons established in his place the Asura who finds the light, by the third act,<br> As fathers, they have set their heritage on earth, their offspring, as a thread continuously spun out.<br> 7 As in a ship through billows, so through regions of air, with blessings, through toils and troubles<br> Hath B&#7771;haduktha brought his seed with glory, and placed it here and in the realms beyond us.</p>
