<p>1. HERE is your ghostly kinship, here, O Men: they came desirous to these holy rites with store of wealth,<br> With wondrous arts, whereby, with schemes to meet each need, Ye gained, Sudhanvan's Sons! your share in sacrifice.<br> 2 The mighty powers wherewith. ye formed the chalices, the thought by which ye drew the cow from out the hide,<br> The intellect wherewith ye wrought the two Bay Steeds,&#151;through these, O &#7770;bhus, ye attained divinity.<br> 3 Friendship with Indra have the &#7770;bhus, fully gained: grandsons of Manu, they skilfully urged the work.<br> Sudhanvan's Children won them everlasting life, serving with holy rites, pious with noble acts.<br> 4:In company with Indra come ye to the juice, then gloriously shall your wishes be fulfilled.<br> Not to be paragoned, ye Priests, are your good deeds, nor your heroic acts, &#7770;bhus, Sudhanvan's Sons.<br> 5 O Indra, with the &#7770;bhus, Mighty Ones, pour down the Soma juice effused, well-blent, from both thy hands.<br> Maghalan, urged by song, in the drink-offerer's house rejoice thee with the Heroes, with Sudhanvan's Sons.<br> 6 With &#7770;bhu near, and V&#257;ja, Indra, here exult, with Saci, praised of many, in the juice we pour.<br> These homes wherein we dwell have turned themselves to thee, -devotions to the Gods, as laws of men ordain.<br> 7 Come with the mighty &#7770;bhus, Indra, come to us, strengthening with thy help the singer's holy praise;<br> At hundred eager calls come to the living man, with thousand arts attend the act of sacrifice.</p>
