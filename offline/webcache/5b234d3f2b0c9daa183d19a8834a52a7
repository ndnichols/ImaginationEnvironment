<TD><P>Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and   
the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the ELOHIYM of Jacob, and    
the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2> 
<H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>The Spirit of YHVH spake by me, and his word was in my    
tongue.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>The    
ELOHIYM of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men 
must be just, ruling in the fear of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And he shall be as the light of the morning, when 
the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing    
out of the earth by clear shining after rain.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Although my house be not so with EL; yet he    
hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for 
this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to         
grow.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>But the  
sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot  
be taken with hands:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff 
of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>These be the      
names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat,    
chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear   
against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And after him was Eleazar the son   
of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied   
the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of     
Israel were gone away:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and   
his hand clave unto the sword: and YHVH wrought a great victory that day; and   
the people returned after him only to spoil.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the   
Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a  
piece of ground full of lentils: and the people fled from the Philistines.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>But he stood in 
the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and YHVH    
wrought a great victory.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the   
harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched 
in the valley of Rephaim.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>      
14</H4></TD><TD><P>And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the       
Philistines was then in Bethlehem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15> 
<H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me    
drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And the three mighty men  
brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of    
Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David:          
nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto YHVH.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, Be it   
far from me, O YHVH, that I should do this: is not this the blood of the men    
that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These    
things did these three mighty men.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18> 
<H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah,    
was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and    
slew them, and had the name among three.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Was he not most honorable of three? therefore   
he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And Benaiah the son  
of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he   
slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst   
of a pit in time of snow:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>      
21</H4></TD><TD><P>And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had  
a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the      
spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>These things did Benaiah  
the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>He was more honorable than    
the thirty, but he attained not to the first three. And David set him over his
