Hirah.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And     
Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he

wicked in the sight of YHVH; and YHVH slew him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy       
brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And Onan knew that the seed

wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his    
brother.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And

Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my

And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And in process of time the daughter of Shuah 
Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers

Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And she put her widow's   
garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and    
sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah   
was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not   
that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that   
thou mayest come in unto me?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>

give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is   
in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by   
him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And she 
arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of 
her widowhood.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive  
his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Then he asked the men of that     
place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they   
said, There was no harlot in this place.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this  
place.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid,

told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, 
behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let 
her be burnt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the    
man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee,      
whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And Judah acknowledged them, and  
said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to       
Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass in the time of her       
travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, when she travailed,     
that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a   
scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth?   
this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.</P></TD></TR>

his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called 
Zarah.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M.
