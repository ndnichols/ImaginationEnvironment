For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of   
the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year     
continually make the comers thereunto perfect.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>For then would they not have ceased to be      
offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more       
conscience of sins.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every  
year.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>For it   
is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore when he 
cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but  
a body hast thou prepared me:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>   
6</H4></TD><TD><P>In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no    
pleasure.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Then 
said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy   
will, O ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering  
for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by 
the law;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Then  
said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O ELOHIYM. He taketh away the first, that   
he may establish the second.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>   
10</H4></TD><TD><P>By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of  
the body of YAHSHUA MASHIYACH once for all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And every priest standeth daily ministering and 
offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>But this man,   
after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right     
hand of ELOHIYM;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>For by one      
offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Whereof the Holy Ghost also   
is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>This is the covenant that I will  
make with them after those days, saith YHVH, I will put my laws into their      
hearts, and in their minds will I write them;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And their sins and iniquities will I         
remember no more.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Having          
therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of         
YAHSHUA,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>By  
a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that  
is to say, his flesh;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And having an high priest over the house of ELOHIYM;</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Let us draw near with a   
true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil 
conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Let us hold fast the profession   
of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And let us consider one   
another to provoke unto love and to good works:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves    
together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the  
more, as ye see the day approaching.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>For if we sin wilfully after that we have       
received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for      
sins,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>But a  
certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall      
devour the adversaries.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three   
witnesses:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath  
trodden under foot the Son of ELOHIYM, and hath counted the blood of the        
covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite   
unto the Spirit of grace?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>      
30</H4></TD><TD><P>For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, 
I will recompense, saith YHVH. And again, YHVH shall judge his people.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>It is a fearful      
thing to fall into the hands of the living EL.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>But call to remembrance the former days, in  
which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>Partly, whilst  
ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly,      
whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>For ye had compassion of me in my 
bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that 
ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>Cast not away therefore your      
confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>For ye have need of patience,     
that, after ye have done the will of ELOHIYM, ye might receive the promise.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>For yet a       
little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>Now the just shall   
live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in      
him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>But we  
are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the   
saving of the soul.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by
