1</H4></TD><TD><P>Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward 
the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the         
separate place, and which was before the building toward the north.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Before the length of   
an hundred cubits was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Over against the       
twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and over against the pavement     
which was for the utter court, was gallery against gallery in three stories.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And before the    
chambers was a walk to ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their 
doors toward the north.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were higher  
than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>For they were in three 
stories, but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore the        
building was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the        
ground.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
the wall that was without over against the chambers, toward the utter court on  
the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>For the length of the       
chambers that were in the utter court was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the     
temple were an hundred cubits.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>  
9</H4></TD><TD><P>And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, 
as one goeth into them from the utter court.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>The chambers were in the thickness of the wall  
of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against 
the building.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers which were   
toward the north, as long as they, and as broad as they: and all their goings   
out were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And according   
to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door in the head  
of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one       
entereth into them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which   
are before the separate place, they be holy chambers, where the priests that    
approach unto YHVH shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the     
most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass 
offering; for the place is holy.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14>   
<H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go   
out of the holy place into the utter court, but there they shall lay their      
garments wherein they minister; for they are holy; and shall put on other       
garments, and shall approach to those things which are for the people.</P></TD>

an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose  
prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>He measured the east side with    
the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>He measured the 
north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.</P></TD>

south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>He turned about to the west side, 
and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>He measured it by the four sides: 
it had a wall round about, five hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to  
make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place.</P></TD></TR>
