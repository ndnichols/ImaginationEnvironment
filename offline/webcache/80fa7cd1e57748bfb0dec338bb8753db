<p>1. DRINK thou this Soma, Indra, Lord of Soma; drink thou the draught of noonday which thou Iovest.<br> Puffing thy cheeks, impetuous, liberal Giver, here loose thy two Bay Horses and rejoice thee.<br> 2 Quaff it pure, meal-blent, mixt with milk, O Indra; we have poured forth the Soma for thy rapture.<br> Knit with the prayer-fulfilling band of Maruts, yea, with the Rudras, drink till thou art sated;<br> 3 Those who gave increase to thy strength and vigour; the Maruts singing forth thy might, O Indra.<br> Drink thou, O fair of cheek, whose hand wields thunder, with Rudras banded, at our noon libation.<br> 4 They, even the Maruts who were there, excited with song the meath-created strength of Indra.<br> By them impelled to act he reached the vitals Of V&#7771;tra, though he deemed that none might wound him.<br> 5 Pleased, like a man, with our libation, Indra, drink, for enduring hero might, the Soma.<br> Lord of Bays, moved by sacrifice come hither: thou with the Swift Ones stirrest floods and waters.<br> 6 When thou didst loose the streams to run like racers in the swift contest, having smitten V&#7771;tra<br> With flying weapon where he lay, O Indra, and, godless, kept the Goddesses encompassed.<br> 7 With reverence let us worship mighty Indra, great and sublime, eternal, everyouthful,<br> Whose greatness the dear world-halves have not measured, no, nor conceived the might of him the Holy.<br> 8 Many are Indra's nobly wrought achievements, and none of all the Gods transgress his statutes.<br> He beareth up this earth and heaven, and, doer of marvels, he begot the Sun and Morning.<br> 9 Herein, O Guileless One, is thy true greatness, that soon as born thou drankest up the Soma.<br> Days may not check the power of thee the Mighty, nor the nights, Indra, nor the months, nor autumns.<br> 10 As soon as thou wast born in highest heaven thou drankest Soma to delight thee, Indra;<br> And when thou hadst pervaded earth and heaven thou wast the first supporter of the singer.<br> 11 Thou, puissant God, more mighty, slewest. Ahi showing his strength when couched around the waters.<br> The heaven itself attained not to thy greatness when with one hip of thine the earth was shadowed.<br> 12 Sacrifice, Indra, made thee wax so mighty, the dear oblation with the flowing Soma.<br> O Worshipful, with worship help our worship, for worship helped thy bolt when slaying Ahi.<br> 13 With sacrifice and wish have I brought Indra; still for new blessings may I turn him hither,<br> Him magnified by ancient songs and praises, by lauds of later time and days yet recent.<br> 14 I have brought forth a song when longing seized me: ere the decisive day will I laud Indra;<br> Then may he safely bear us over trouble, as in a ship, when both sides invocate him.<br> 15 Full is his chalice: Glory! Like a pourer I have filled up the vessel for his drinking.<br> Presented on the right, dear Soma juices have brought us Indra, to rejoice him, hither.<br> 16 Not the deep-flowing flood, O Much-invoked One! not hills that compass thee about restrain thee,<br> Since here incited, for thy friends, O Indra, thou breakest e&#146;en the firm built stall of cattle.<br> 17 Call we on Maghavan, auspicious Indra, best Hero in this fight where spoil is gathered,<br> The Strong who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the V&#7771;tras, wins and gathers riches.</p>
