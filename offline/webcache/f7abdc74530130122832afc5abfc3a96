<TD><P>And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven     
about the space of half an hour.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>
2</H4></TD><TD><P>And I saw the seven angels which stood before ELOHIYM; and to 
them were given seven trumpets.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4> 
3</H4></TD><TD><P>And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a       
golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer  
it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the    
throne.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended   
up before ELOHIYM out of the angel's hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And the angel took the censer, and filled it with 
fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and       
thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And the seven angels which had the seven       
trumpets prepared themselves to sound.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>The first angel sounded, and there followed hail  
and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third   
part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And the second angel sounded,   
and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and    
the third part of the sea became blood;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And the third part of the creatures which were in 
the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And the third   
angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a    
lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of  
waters;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters       
became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made        
bitter.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the    
third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part   
of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the     
night likewise.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying  
with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of   
the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!</P>
