<p>1. TRUTH is the base that bears the earth; by S&#363;rya are the heavens sustained.<br> By Law the &#256;dityas stand secure, and Soma holds his place in heaven.<br> 2 By Soma are the &#256;dityas strong, by Soma mighty is the earth.<br> Thus Soma in the midst of all these constellations hath his place.<br> 3 One thinks, when they have brayed the plant, that he hath drunk the Soma's juice;<br> Of him whom Brahmans truly know as Soma no one ever tastes.<br> 4 Soma, secured by sheltering rules, guarded by hymns in Brhati,<br> Thou standest listening to the stones none tastes of thee who dwells on earth.<br> 5 When they begin to drink thee then, O God, thou swellest out again.<br> V&#257;yu is Soma's guardian God. The Moon is that which shapes the years.<br> 6 Raibhi was her dear bridal friend, and Narasamsi led her home.<br> Lovely was S&#363;rya's robe: she came to that which Gatha had adorned.<br> 7 Thought was the pillow of her couch, sight was the unguent for her eyes:<br> Her treasury was earth and heaven.&#7817;hen S&#363;rya went unto her Lord.<br> 8 Hymns were the cross-bars of the pole, Kurira-metre decked the car:<br> The bridesmen were the A&#347;vin Pair Agni was leader of the train.<br> 9 Soma was he who wooed the maid: the groomsmen were both A&#347;vins, when<br> The Sun-God Savitar bestowed his willing S&#363;rya on her Lord.<br> 10 Her spirit was the bridal car; the covering thereof was heaven:<br> Bright were both Steers that drew it when S&#363;rya approached her husband's, home.<br> 11 Thy Steers were steady, kept in place by holy verse and S&#257;ma-hymn:<br> All car were thy two chariot wheels: thy path was tremulous in the sky,<br> 12 Clean, as thou wentest, were thy wheels wind, was the axle fastened there.<br> S&#363;rya, proceeding to her Lord, mounted a spirit-fashioried car.<br> 13 The bridal pomp of S&#363;rya, which Savitar started, moved along.<br> In Magha days are oxen slain, in Arjuris they wed the bride.<br> 14 When on your three-wheeled chariot, O A&#347;vins, ye came as wooers unto S&#363;rya's bridal,<br> Then all the Gods agreed to your proposal P&#363;&#7779;an as Son elected you as Fathers.<br> 15 O ye Two Lords of lustre, then when ye to S&#363;rya's wooing came,<br> Where was one chariot wheel of yours? Where stood ye for die Sire's command?<br> 16 The Brahmans, by their seasons, know, O S&#363;rya, those two wheels of thine:<br> One kept concealed, those only who are skilled in highest truths have learned.<br> 17 To S&#363;rya and the Deities, to Mitra and to Varu&#7751;a.<br> Who know aright the thing that is, this adoration have I paid.<br> 18 By their own power these Twain in close succession move;<br> They go as playing children round the sacrifice.<br> One of the Pair beholdeth all existing things; the other ordereth seasons and is born again.<br> 19 He, born afresh, is new and new for ever ensign of days he goes before the Mornings<br> Coming, he orders f6r the Gods their portion. The Moon prolongs the days of our existence.<br> 20 Mount this, all-shaped, gold-hued, with strong wheels, fashioned of Kimsuka and Salmali, light-rolling,<br> Bound for the world of life immortal, S&#363;rya: make for thy lord a happy bridal journey.<br> 21 Rise up from hence: this maiden hath a husband. I laud Visvavasu with hymns and homage.<br> Seek in her father's home another fair one, and find the portion from of old assigned thee.<br> 22 Rise up from hence, Visvavasu: with reverence we worship thee.<br> Seek thou another willing maid, and with her husband leave the bride.<br> 23 Straight in direction be the path:s, and thornless, whereon our fellows travel to the wooing.<br> Let Aryaman and Bhaga lead us: perfect, O Gods, the union of the wife and husband.<br> 24 Now from the noose of Varu&#7751;a I free thee, wherewith Most Blessed Savitar hath bound thee.<br> In Law's seat, to the world of virtuous action, I give thee up uninjured with thy consort.<br> 25 Hence, and not thence, I send these free. I make thee softly fettered there.<br> That, Bounteous Indra, she may live blest in her fortune and her sons.<br> 26 Let P&#363;&#7779;an take thy hand and hence conduct thee; may the two A&#347;vins on their car transport thee.<br> Go to the house to be the household's mistress and speak as lady ito thy gathered people.<br> 27 Happy be thou and prosper witlh thy children here: be vigilant to rule thy household in this home.<br> Closely unite thy body with this; man, thy lord. So shall ye, full of years, address your company.<br> 28 Her hue is blue and red: the fienod who clingeth close is driven off.<br> Well thrive the kinsmen of this bride the husband is bourid fast in bonds.<br> 29 Give thou the woollen robe away: deal treasure to the Brahman priests.<br> This female fiend hath got her feet, and as a wife attends her lord.<br> 30 Unlovely is his body when it glistens with this wicked fiend,<br> What time the husband wraps about his limbs the garment of his wife.<br> 31 Consumptions, from her people, which follow the bride's resplendent train,&#151;<br> These let the Holy Gods again bear to the place from which they came.<br> 32 Let not the highway thieves who lie in ambush find the wedded pair.<br> By pleasant ways let them escape the danger, and let foes depart.<br> 33 Signs of good fortune mark the bride come all of you and look at her.<br> Wish her prosperity, and then return unto your homes again.<br> 34 Pungent is this, and bitter this, filled, as it were, with arrow-barbs, Empoisoned and&#7751;ot fit for use.<br> The Brahman who knows S&#363;rya well deserves the garment of the bride.<br> 35 The fringe, the cloth that decks her head, and then the triply parted robe,&#151;<br> Behold the hues which S&#363;rya wears these doth the Brahman purify.<br> 36 I take thy hand in mine for happy fortune that thou mayst reach old age with me thy husband.<br> Gods, Aryaman, Bhaga, Savitar, Purandhi, have given thee to be my household's mistress.<br> 37 O P&#363;&#7779;an, send her on as most auspicious, her who shall be the sharer of my pleasures;<br> Her who shall twine her loving arms about me, and welcome all my love and mine embraces.<br> 38 For thee, with bridal train, they, first, escorted S&#363;rya to her home.<br> Give to the husband in return, Agni, the wife with progeny.<br> 39 Agni hath given the bride again with splendour and with ample life.<br> Long lived be he who is her lord; a hundred autumns let him live.<br> 40 Soma obtained her first of all; next the Gandharva was her lord.<br> Agai was thy third husband: now one bornof woman is thy fourth.<br> 41 Soma to the Gandharva, and to Agni the Gandharva gave:<br> And Agni hath bestowed on me riches and sons and this my spouse.<br> 42 Be ye not parted; dwell ye here reach the full time of human life.<br> With sons and grandsons sport and play, rejoicing in your own abode.<br> 43 So may Praj&#257;pati bring children forth to us; may Aryaman adorn us till old age come nigh.<br> Not inauspicious enter thou thy husband's house: bring blessing to our bipeds and our quadrupeds.<br> 44 Not evil-eyed, no slayer of thy husband, bring weal to cattle, radiant, gentlehearted;<br> Loving the Gods, delightful, bearing heroes, bring blessing to our quadrupeds and bipeds.<br> 45 O Bounteous Indra, make this bride blest in her sons and fortunate.<br> Vouchsafe to her ten sons, and make her husband the eleventh man.<br> 46 Over thy husband's father and thy husband's mother bear full sway.<br> Over the sister of thy lord, over his brothers rule supreme.<br> 47 So may the Universal Gods, so may the Waters join our hearts.<br> May M&#257;tari&#347;van, Dh&#257;tar, and Destri together bind us close.</p>
