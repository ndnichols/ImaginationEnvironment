<p>1. As in the first old times, as all were wont, as now, he draweth forth the power turned hitherward with song,<br> The Princedom throned on holy grass, who findeth light, swift, conquering in the' plants wherein he waxeth strong.<br> 2 Shining to him who leaves heaven's regions undisturbed, which to his sheen who is beneath show fair in light,<br> Good guardian art thou, not to be deceived, Most Wise! Far from deceits thy name dwelleth in holy Law.<br> 3 Truth waits upon oblation present and to come: naught checks him in his way, this vic tory- bringing Priest:<br> The Mighty Child who glides along the sacred grass, the undecaying Youth set in the midst of plants.<br> 4 These come, well-yoked, to you for furtherance in the rite: down come the twinborn strengtheners of Law for him,<br> With reins easily guided and commanding all. In the deep fall the hide stealeth away their names.<br> 5 Thou, moving beauteously in visibly pregnant ones, snatching with trees the branching plant that grasps the juice,<br> Shinest, true Singer! mid the upholders of the voice. Increase thy Consorts thou, lively at sacrifice.<br> 6 Like as he is beheld such is he said to be.<br> They with effectual splendour in the floods have made<br> Earth yield us room enough and amply wide extent, great might invincible, with store of hero sons.<br> 7 S&#363;rya the Sage, as if unwedded, with a Spouse, in battle-loving spirit moveth o&#146;er the foes.<br> May he, self-excellent, grant us a sheltering home, a house that wards the fierce heat off on every side.<br> 8 Thy name, sung forth by &#7770;&#7779;is in these hymns of ours, goes to the loftier One with this swift mover's light.<br> By skill he wins the boon whereon his heart is set: he who bestirs himself shall bring the thing to pass.<br> 9 The chief and best of these abideth in the sea, nor doth libation fail wherein it is prolonged.<br> The heart of him who praiseth trembleth not in fear there where the hymn is found connected with the pure.<br> 10 For it is he: with though to of Ksatra, Manasa, of Yajata, and Sadhri, and Evavada,<br> With Avatsara's sweet songs will we strive to win the mightiest strength which even he who knows should gain.<br> 11 The Hawk is their full source, girth-stretching rapturous drink of Visvavara, of Mayin, and Yajata.<br> They ever seek a fresh draught so that they may come, know when thy time to halt and drink thy fill is near.<br> 12 Sadaprna the holy, Tarya, Srutavit, and Bahuvrkta, joined with you, have slain the foes.<br> He gains his wish in both the worlds and brightly shines-when he adores the host with well-advancing steeds.<br> 13 The worshipper's defender is Sutambhara, producer and uplifter of all holy thoughts.<br> The milch-cow brought, sweet-flavoured milk was dealt around. Who speaks the bidding text knows this, not he who sleeps.<br> 11 The sacred hymns love him who wakes and watches: to him who watches come the S&#257;ma verses.<br> This Soma saith unto the man who watches, I rest and have my dwelling in thy friendship.<br> 15 Agni is watchful, and the gcas love him; Agni is watchful, S&#257;ma verses seek him.<br> Agni is watchful, to him saith this Soma, I rest and have my dwelling in thy friendship.</p>
