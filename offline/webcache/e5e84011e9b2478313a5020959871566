<TD><P>And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto 
Ahab, As YHVH ELOHIYM of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be 
dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And the word of YHVH came unto him, 
saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Get    
thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that 
is before Jordan.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded    
the ravens to feed thee there.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>  
5</H4></TD><TD><P>So he went and did according unto the word of YHVH: for he    
went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And the ravens brought him      
bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he      
drank of the brook.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because      
there had been no rain in the land.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8> 
<H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And the word of YHVH came unto him, saying,</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Arise, get thee to          
Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded  
a widow woman there to sustain thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he  
came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of    
sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water   
in a vessel, that I may drink.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4> 
11</H4></TD><TD><P>And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and      
said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And she said, As YHVH thy     
ELOHIYM liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a    
little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in 
and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And Elijah said unto her,     
Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, 
and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>For thus saith YHVH ELOHIYM   
of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil   
fail, until the day that YHVH sendeth rain upon the earth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And she went and did according to 
the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And the barrel  
of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of 
YHVH, which he spake by Elijah.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>
17</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the  
woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that 
there was no breath left in him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18>   
<H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O 
thou man of ELOHIYM? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and   
to slay my son?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and 
carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And he cried    
unto YHVH, and said, O YHVH my ELOHIYM, hast thou also brought evil upon the    
widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And he stretched himself upon the child      
three times, and cried unto YHVH, and said, O YHVH my ELOHIYM, I pray thee, let 
this child's soul come into him again.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH heard the voice of Elijah; and the     
soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And Elijah took the child, and    
brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his  
mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I  
know that thou art a man of ELOHIYM, and that the word of YHVH in thy mouth is  
truth.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M.
