<p>1. HE who, as Sovran Lord of men, moves with his chariots unrestrained,<br> The V&#7771;tra-slayer vanquisher, of fighting hosts, preeminent, is praised with song.<br> 2 Honour that Indra, Puruhanman! for his aid, in whose sustaining hand of old,<br> The splendid bolt of thunder was deposited, as the great Sun was set in heaven.<br> 3 No one by deed attains to him who works and strengthens evermore:<br> No, not by sacrifice, to Indra. praised o all, resistless, daring, bold in might.<br> 4 The potent Conqueror, invincible in war, him at whose birth the Mighty Ones,<br> The Kine who spread <A HREF="errata.htm#23">afar</A>, sent their loud voices out, heavens, earths seat their loud voices out,<br> 5 O Indra, if a hundred heavens and if a hundred earths were thine&#151;<br> No, not a thousand Suns could match thee at thy birth, not both the worlds, O Thunderer.<br> 6 Thou, Hero, hast performed thy hero deeds with might, yea, all with strength, O Strongest One.<br> Maghavan, help us to a stable full of kine, O Thunderer, with wondrous aids.<br> 7 Let not a godless mortal gain this food, O thou whose life is long!<br> But one who yokes the bright-hued steeds, the Etasas, even Indra yoker of the Bays.<br> 8 Urge ye the Conqueror to give, your Indra greatly to be praised,<br> To be invoked in shallow waters and in depths, to be invoked in deeds of might.<br> 9 O Vasu, O thou Hero, raise us up to ample opulence.<br> Raise us to gain of mighty wealth, O Maghavan, O Indra, to sublime renown.<br> 10 Indra, thou justifiest us, and tramplest down thy slanderers.<br> Guard thyself, valiant Hero, in thy vital parts: strike down the D&#257;sa with thy blows.<br> 11 The man who brings no sacrifice, inhuman, godless, infidel,<br> Him let his friend the mountain cast to rapid death, the mountain cast the Dasyu down.<br> 12 O Mightiest Indra, loving us, gather thou up, as grains of corn,<br> Within thine hand, of these their kine, to give away, yea, gather twice as loving us.<br> 13 O my companions, wish for power. How may we perfect Sara's praise,<br> The liberal princely patron, never to be harmed?<br> 14 By many a sage whose grass is trimmed thou art continually praised,<br> That thou, O Sara, hast bestowed here one and here another calf.<br> 15 The noble, Suradeva's son, hath brought a calf, led by the car to three of us.<br> As a chief brings a goat to milk.</p>
