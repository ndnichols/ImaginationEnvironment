<TD><P>After these things the ADONAY appointed other seventy also, and sent     
them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself  
would come.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are  
few: pray ye therefore the ELOHIYM of the harvest, that he would send forth     
labourers into his harvest.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>

wolves.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Carry  
neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And into whatsoever house   
ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And in the same house remain,       
eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his 
hire. Go not from house to house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8>   
<H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you,  
eat such things as are set before you:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

them, The kingdom of EL is come nigh unto you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they

</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Even the very   
dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you:            
notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of EL is come nigh unto    
you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>But I   
say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for   
that city.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had  
been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great      
while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>But it shall be more tolerable    
for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And thou, Capernaum, which art

VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>He that heareth you heareth me;   
and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him  
that sent me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, ADONAY, even the devils are 
subject unto us through thy name.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18>  
<H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall  
from heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>
Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all  
the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Notwithstanding in this   
rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because 
your names are written in heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21>  
<H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>In that hour YAHSHUA rejoiced in spirit, and said, I     
thank thee, O Father, ELOHIYM of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these     
things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so,   
Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but   
the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And he turned him unto his        
disciples, and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that   
ye see:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>For  
I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which 
ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and     
have not heard them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying,    
Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>He said unto him, What is written 
in the law? how readest thou?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>  
27</H4></TD><TD><P>And he answering said, Thou shalt love YHVH thy ELOHIYM with 
all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all   
thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: 
this do, and thou shalt live.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>  
29</H4></TD><TD><P>But he, willing to justify himself, said unto YAHSHUA, And   
who is my neighbour?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem  
to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and      
wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And by chance there came down a   
certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other         
side.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed 
by on the other side.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and    
when he saw him, he had compassion on him,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>And went to him, and bound up his wounds,       
pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an    
inn, and took care of him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>     
35</H4></TD><TD><P>And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence,   
and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever  
thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>Which now of these three,         
thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, He that      
shewed mercy on him. Then said YAHSHUA unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>Now it came to  
pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman 
named Martha received him into her house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>And she had a sister called Mary, which also    
sat at YAHSHUA' feet, and heard his word.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and 
came to him, and said, ADONAY, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me   
to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA answered and said     
unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things:</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>But one thing   
is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away  
from her.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M.
