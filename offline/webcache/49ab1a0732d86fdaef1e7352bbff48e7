<p>1. To Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, to the Mighty whom the Maruts follow let your hymns born in song go forth, Evayamarut;<br> To the impetuous, strong band, adorned with bracelets, that rushes on in joy and ever roars for vigour.<br> 2 They who with might were manifest, and who willingly by their own knowledge told it forth, Evayamarut.<br> Maruts, this strength of yours no wisdom comprehendeth: through their gifts' greatness they are moveless as the mountains.<br> 3 Who by the psalm they sing are heard, from lofty heaven, the strong, the brightly shining Ones, Evayamarut;<br> In whose abode there is no mightier one to move them, whose lightnings are as fires, who urge the roaring rivers.<br> 4 He of the Mighty Stride forth strode, Evayamarut, out of the spacious dwelling-place, their home in common.<br> When he, himself, hath yoked his emulous strong horses on heights, he cometh forth, joy-giving, with the Heroes.<br> 5 Like your tremendous roar, the rainer with light flashing, strong, speeding, hath made all tremble, Evayamarut,<br> Wherewith victorious ye, self-luminous, press onward, with strong reins, decked with gold, impetuous and well-weaponed.<br> 6 Unbounded is your greatness, ye of mighty power: may your bright vigour be our aid, Evayamarut;<br> For ye are visible helpers in the time of trouble: like fires, aglow with light, save us from shame and insult.<br> 7 So may the Rudras, mighty warriors, Evayamarut, with splendid brilliancy, like fires, be our protectors;<br> They whose terrestrial dwelling-place is wide-extended, whom none suspect of sin, whose bands have lofty courage.<br> 8 Come in a friendly spirit, come to us, O Maruts, and hear his call who praises you, Evayamarut.<br> Like car-borne men, one-minded with the mighty Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, keep enmity far from us with your deeds of wonder.<br> 9 Come to our sacrifice, ye Hnly Ones, to bless it, and, free from demons, hear our call, Evayamarut.</p>
