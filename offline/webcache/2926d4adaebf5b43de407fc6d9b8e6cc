ELOHIYM met him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is ELOHIYM's host: and he called the

the land of Seir, the country of Edom.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye      
speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with    
Laban, and stayed there until now:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5>  
<H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and  
womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy    
sight.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And the 
messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he  
cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Jacob was greatly afraid and   
distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and    
herds, and the camels, into two bands;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And said, If Esau come to the one company, and    
smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And Jacob said, O ELOHIYM of my

Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>I am not worthy 
of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast showed   
unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am     
become two bands.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of   
Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the   
children.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of   
the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And he lodged there that same     
night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his           
brother;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Two 
hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Thirty milch    
camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten   
foals.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and 
said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and  
drove.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and       
asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are      
these before thee?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent   
unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And so commanded he the second,   
and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall   
ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob  
is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth       
before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of    
me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>So went  
the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And he rose up  
that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven   
sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And he took them, and sent them over the brook, 
and sent over that he had.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>     
24</H4></TD><TD><P>And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him  
until the breaking of the day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4> 
25</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he        
touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of     
joint, as he wrestled with him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>
26</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I 
will not let thee go, except thou bless me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he  
said, Jacob.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>
And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a       
prince hast thou power with ELOHIYM and with men, and hast prevailed.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And Jacob asked him, 
and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that     
thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And Jacob called the name of the  
place Peniel: for I have seen ELOHIYM face to face, and my life is              
preserved.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his      
thigh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>      
Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is    
upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of   
Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software
