<p>1 WHO now is he, what God among Immortals, of whose auspicious name we may bethink us?<br> Who shall to mighty Aditi restore us, that I may see my Father and my Mother?<br> 2 Agni the God the first among the Immortals,&#151;of his auspicious name let us bethink us.<br> He shall to mighty Aditi restore us, that I may see my Father and my Mother.<br> 3 To thee, O Savitar, the Lord of precious things, who helpest us<br> Continually, for our share we come&#151;<br> 4 Wealth, highly lauded ere reproach hath fallen on it, which is laid,<br> Free from all hatred, in thy hands<br> 5 Through thy protection may we come to even the height of affluence<br> Which Bhaga hath dealt out to us.<br> 6 Ne&#146;er have those birds that fly through air attained to thy high dominion or thy might or spirit;<br> Nor these the waters that flow on for ever, nor hills, abaters of the wind's wild fury.<br> 7 Varu&#7751;a, King, of hallowed might, sustaineth erect the Tree's stem in the baseless region.<br> Its rays, whose root is high above, stream downward. Deep may they sink within us, and be hidden.<br> 8 King Varu&#7751;a hath made a spacious pathway, a pathway for the Sun wherein to travel.<br> Where no way was he made him set his footstep, and warned afar whate&#146;er afflicts the spirit.<br> 9 A hundred balms are thine, O King, a thousand; deep and wide-reaching also be thy favours.<br> Far from us, far away drive thou Destruction. Put from us e&#146;en the sin we have committed.<br> 10 Whither by day depart the constellations that shine at night, set high in heaven above us?<br> Varu&#7751;a's holy laws remain unweakened, and through the night the Moon moves on in splendor<br> 11 I ask this of thee with my prayer adoring; thy worshipper craves this with his oblation.<br> Varu&#7751;a, stay thou here and be not angry; steal not our life from us, O thou Wide-Ruler.<br> 12 Nightly and daily this one thing they tell me, this too the thought of mine own heart repeateth.<br> May he to whom prayed fettered &#346;una&#7717;&#347;epa, may he the Sovran Varu&#7751;a release us.<br> 13 Bound to three pillars captured &#346;una&#7717;&#347;epa thus to the &#256;ditya made his supplication.<br> Him may the Sovran Varu&#7751;a deliver, wise, ne&#146;er deceived, loosen the bonds that bind him.<br> 14 With bending down, oblations, sacrifices, O Varu&#7751;a, we deprecate thine anger:<br> Wise Asura, thou King of wide dominion, loosen the bonds of sins by us committed.<br> 15 Loosen the bonds, O Varu&#7751;a, that hold me, loosen the bonds above, between, and under.<br> So in thy holy law may we made sinless belong to Aditi, O thou &#256;ditya.</p>
