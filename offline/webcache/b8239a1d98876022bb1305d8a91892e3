<TD><P>And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and   
horses, and fifty men to run before him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the   
way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came   
to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city  
art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And Absalom said unto  
him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the    
king to hear thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every 
man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him         
justice!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance, he put forth 
his hand, and took him, and kissed him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that 
came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of        
Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And it 
came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee,   
let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto YHVH, in Hebron.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>For thy servant vowed a vow 
while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If YHVH shall bring me again indeed   
to Jerusalem, then I will serve YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he    
arose, and went to Hebron.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>     
10</H4></TD><TD><P>But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel,  
saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom 
reigneth in Hebron.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were        
called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And Absalom sent for 
Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, from his city, even from Giloh,     
while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people      
increased continually with Absalom.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13>
<H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts  
of the men of Israel are after Absalom.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And David said unto all his servants that were  
with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape     
from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring     
evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And the king's servants said  
unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king 
shall appoint.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left  
ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And the king went forth, and all  
the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And all his servants passed   
on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the     
Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the  
king.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Then   
said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return   
to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou art a stranger, and also an     
exile.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>      
Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down   
with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren:    
mercy and truth be with thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>  
21</H4></TD><TD><P>And Ittai answered the king, and said, As YHVH liveth, and   
as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be,     
whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And David said to Ittai, Go   
and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the  
little ones that were with him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>
23</H4></TD><TD><P>And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the      
people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all 
the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And lo Zadok also, and all the    
Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of ELOHIYM: and they set 
down the ark of ELOHIYM; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done    
passing out of the city.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of ELOHIYM into    
the city: if I shall find favor in the eyes of YHVH, he will bring me again,    
and show me both it, and his habitation:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee;  
behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>The king said also unto Zadok 
the priest, Art not thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two    
sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>See, I will tarry in the  
plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Zadok therefore and  
Abiathar carried the ark of ELOHIYM again to Jerusalem: and they tarried        
there.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had    
his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that was with him    
covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And one told David,  
saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O    
YHVH, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, 
that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped ELOHIYM,  
behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon  
his head:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden   
unto me:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>But 
if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O      
king; as I have been thy father's servant hitherto, so will I now also be thy   
servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And hast thou not there   
with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what      
thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to     
Zadok and Abiathar the priests.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>
36</H4></TD><TD><P>Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz    
Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send unto me     
every thing that ye can hear.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>  
37</H4></TD><TD><P>So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom     
came into Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000
