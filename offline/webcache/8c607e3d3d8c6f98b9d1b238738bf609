<TD><P>And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the       
mother of YAHSHUA was there:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>    
2</H4></TD><TD><P>And both YAHSHUA was called, and his disciples, to the        
marriage.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
when they wanted wine, the mother of YAHSHUA saith unto him, They have no       
wine.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA  
saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet        
come.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>His      
mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And there were set     
there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews,    
containing two or three firkins apiece.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with  
water. And they filled them up to the brim.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear    
unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>When the ruler of the feast had     
tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the       
servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the       
bridegroom,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and    
when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good 
wine until now.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD>
<P>This beginning of miracles did YAHSHUA in Cana of Galilee, and manifested    
forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>After this he went down to        
Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they    
continued there not many days.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4> 
13</H4></TD><TD><P>And the Jews' passover was at hand, and YAHSHUA went up to   
Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the       
changers of money sitting:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>     
15</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them 
all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the          
changers' money, and overthrew the tables;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And said unto them that sold doves, Take these  
things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And his disciples         
remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Then answered   
the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou    
doest these things?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD>
<TD><P>YAHSHUA answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three   
days I will raise it up.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in          
building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>But he spake of the temple of his 
body.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>When   
therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said 
this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which YAHSHUA had 
said.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Now    
when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in    
his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>But YAHSHUA did not commit        
himself unto them, because he knew all men,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And needed not that any should testify of man:  
for he knew what was in man.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
