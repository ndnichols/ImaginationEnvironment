<p>1. INSTRUCT me, all ye Gods, how I, elected your Priest, must seat me here, and how address you.<br> Instruct me how to deal to each his portion, and by what ' path to bring you man's oblation.<br> 2 I sit as Priest most skilled in sacrificing: the Maruts and all Deities impel me.<br> A&#347;vins, each day yours is the Adhvaryu's duty: Brahman and wood are here: &#146;tis yours to offer.<br> 3 Who is the Priest? Is he the Priest of Yama? On whom is thrust this God-appointed honour?<br> He springs to life each month, each day that passes; so Gods have made him their oblation-bearer.<br> 4 The Gods have made me bearer of oblations, who slipped away and passed through many troubles.<br> Wise Agni shall ordain for us the worship, whether five-wayed, threefold, or seven-threaded.<br> 5 So will I win you strength and life for ever. O Gods, that I may give you room and freedom.<br> To Indra's arms would I consign the thunder; in all these battles shall he then be victor.<br> 6 The Deities three hundred and thirty-nine, have served and honoured Agni,<br> Strewn sacred grass, anointed him with butter, and seated him as Priest, the Gods&#146; Invoker.</p>
