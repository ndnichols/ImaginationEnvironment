The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man spake unto       
Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2>  
<H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the   
understanding of a man.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Who hath ascended 
up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath 
bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth?  
what is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Every word of ELOAHH is     
pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Add thou not unto his words,

them not before I die:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor     
riches; feed me with food convenient for me:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is    
YHVH? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my ELOHIYM in vain.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Accuse not a

filthiness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P> 
There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted 
up.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>There is 
a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, to      
devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>The horseleach hath two   
daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, 
yea, four things say not, It is enough:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that  
is not filled with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>The eye that mocketh 
at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall 
pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>There be three things which are too          
wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a 
serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of  
a man with a maid.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her       
mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>For three things the earth is disquieted, and   
for four which it cannot bear:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4> 
22</H4></TD><TD><P>For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled 
with meat;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>  
For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her    
mistress.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>   
There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding    
wise:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>The    
ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;</P>

but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>The locusts have no king, yet 
go they forth all of them by bands;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28>
<H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings'  
palaces.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>    
There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in going:</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>A lion which is      
strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>A greyhound; an he goat also; and 
a king, against whom there is no rising up.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up       
thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>Surely the churning  
of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth      
blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
