<p>1. FIRST worship those who come at early morning: let the Twain drink before the giftless niggard.<br> The A&#347;vins claim the sacrifice at daybreak: the sages yielding the first share extol them.<br> 2 Worship at dawn and instigate the A&#347;vins: nor is the worshipper at eve rejected.<br> Besides ourselves another craves and worships: each first in worship is most highly favoured.<br> 3 Covered with gold, meath-tinted, dropping fatness, your chariot with its freight of food comes hither,<br> Swift as thought, A&#347;vins, rapid as the tempest, wherewith ye travel over all obstructions.<br> 4 He who hath served most often the N&#257;satyas, and gives the sweetest food at distribution,<br> Furthers with his own holy works his offspring, and ever passes those whose flames ascend not.<br> 5 May we obtain the A&#347;vins' newest favour, and gain their health-bestowing happy guidance.<br> Bring riches hither unto us, and heroes, and all felicity and joy, Immortals!</p>
