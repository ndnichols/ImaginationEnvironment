After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And found a certain Jew     
named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla;  
(because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came    
unto them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their 
occupation they were tentmakers.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>
4</H4></TD><TD><P>And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded 
the Jews and the Greeks.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was     
pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that YAHSHUA was MASHIYACH.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they     
opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them,   
Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean; from henceforth I will go unto   
the Gentiles.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus,   
one that worshipped ELOHIYM, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And Crispus, the chief 
ruler of the synagogue, believed on the ADONAY with all his house; and many of  
the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Then spake YHVH to Paul in the      
night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>For I am with thee,  
and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this       
city.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And he 
continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of ELOHIYM among       
them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one       
accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Saying, This fellow persuadeth    
men to worship ELOHIYM contrary to the law.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And when Paul was now about to open his mouth,  
Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O   
ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>But if it be a question of words  
and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such       
matters.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
he drave them from the judgment seat.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief   
ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared 
for none of those things.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>      
18</H4></TD><TD><P>And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then 
took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him      
Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And he came to  
Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and    
reasoned with the Jews.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented  
not;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>But     
bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in  
Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if ELOHIYM will. And he sailed     
from Ephesus.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he  
went down to Antioch.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over  
all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the          
disciples.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and       
mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>This man was instructed in the way of the       
ADONAY; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the     
things of the ADONAY, knowing only the baptism of John.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And he began to speak boldly in   
the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto     
them, and expounded unto him the way of ELOHIYM more perfectly.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he was disposed  
to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive     
him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through         
grace:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>For   
he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures   
that YAHSHUA was MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright
