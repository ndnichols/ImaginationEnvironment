the fire may devour thy cedars.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>

are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come   
down.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>There is 
a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is spoiled: a voice of 
the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus saith YHVH my ELOHIYM; 
Feed the flock of the slaughter;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>
5</H4></TD><TD><P>Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty:   
and they that sell them say, Blessed be YHVH; for I am rich: and their own      
shepherds pity them not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith YHVH:    
but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbour's hand, and into   
the hand of his king: and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I    
will not deliver them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of the     
flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I  
called Bands; and I fed the flock.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8>  
<H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul  
lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said I, I will not feed you: that that    
dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let   
the rest eat every one the flesh of another.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the           
people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me     
knew that it was the word of YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12> 
<H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my       
price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of       
silver.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
YHVH said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prised at 
of them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in 
the house of YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD>

shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor    
heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat   
the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

leaveth the flock! the sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his 
arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.</P>
