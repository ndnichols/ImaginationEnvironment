</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>Be ye followers   
of me, even as I also am of MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me   
in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>But I would have you   
know, that the head of every man is MASHIYACH; and the head of the woman is the 
man; and the head of MASHIYACH is ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Every man praying or prophesying, having his head 
covered, dishonoureth his head.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4> 
5</H4></TD><TD><P>But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head     
uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were        
shaven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>For if 
the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a     
woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>For a man indeed ought not to cover 
his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of ELOHIYM: but the woman is   
the glory of the man.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD>
<TD><P>For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Neither was the man created 
for the woman; but the woman for the man.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>For this cause ought the woman to have power on 
her head because of the angels.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>
11</H4></TD><TD><P>Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither   
the woman without the man, in the ADONAY.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>For as the woman is of the man, even so is the  
man also by the woman; but all things of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Judge in yourselves: is it comely 
that a woman pray unto ELOHIYM uncovered?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if 
a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory 
to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>But if any man seem to be         
contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of ELOHIYM.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Now in this that I   
declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better,    
but for the worse.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there 
be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>For there must be also heresies   
among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>When ye come         
together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the ADONAY's supper.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>For in eating   
every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is 
drunken.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>    
What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of    
ELOHIYM, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise  
you in this? I praise you not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4> 
23</H4></TD><TD><P>For I have received of the ADONAY that which also I          
delivered unto you, That the ADONAY YAHSHUA the same night in which he was      
betrayed took bread:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat:     
this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>After the same       
manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new    
testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of     
me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>For as   
often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the ADONAY's death   
till he come.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the ADONAY,  
unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the ADONAY.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>But let a man examine     
himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>For he that eateth and    
drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning   
the ADONAY's body.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>For if we would 
judge ourselves, we should not be judged.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>But when we are judged, we are chastened of     
YHVH, that we should not be condemned with the world.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore, my brethren, when ye   
come together to eat, tarry one for another.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>And if any man hunger, let him eat at home;     
that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order   
when I come.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John
