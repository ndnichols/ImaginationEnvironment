<p>1. I INVOCATE your Son of Strength, the Youthful, with hymns, the Youngest God, whose speech is guileless;<br> Sage who sends wealth comprising every treasure, bringer of many boons, devoid of malice.<br> 2 At eve and morn thy pious servants bring thee their precious gifts, O Priest of many aspects,<br> On whom, the Purifier, all things living as on firm. ground their happiness have stablished.<br> 3 Thou from of old hast dwelt among these people, by mental power the charioteer of blessings.<br> Hence sendest thou, O sapient J&#257;tavedas, to him who serves thee treasures in succession.<br> 4 Agni, whoever secretly attacks us, the neighbour, thou with Mitra's might! who harms us,<br> Burn him with thine own Steers for ever youthful, burning with burning heat, thou fiercest burner.<br> 5 He who serves thee with sacrifice and fuel, with hymn, O Son of Strength, and chanted praises,<br> Shines out, Immortal! in the midst of mortals, a sage, with wealth, with splendour and with glory.<br> 6 Do this, O Agni, when we urge thee, quickly, triumphant in thy might subdue our foemen.<br> When thou art praised with words and decked with brightness, accept this chanted hymn, the singer's worship.<br> 7 Help us, that we may gain this wish, O Agni, gain riches, Wealthy One! with store of heroes.<br> Desiring strength from thee may we be strengthened, and win, Eternal! thine eternal glory.</p>
