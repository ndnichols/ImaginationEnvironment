And he lighted the lamps before YHVH; as YHVH commanded Moses.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And he put the golden altar

offering; as YHVH commanded Moses.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30> 
<H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And he set the laver between the tent of the             
congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash withal.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses and Aaron and   
his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>When they went into the tent of   
the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as YHVH  
commanded Moses.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and 
set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>Then a cloud covered the  
tent of the congregation, and the glory of YHVH filled the tabernacle.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses was not    
able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode        
thereon, and the glory of YHVH filled the tabernacle.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the cloud was taken up   
from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their       
journeys:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>   
But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that   
it was taken up.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>For the cloud of YHVH was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it 
by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their         
journeys.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M.
