<TD><P>And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels     
having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of            
ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And I 
saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the   
victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the     
number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of ELOHIYM.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And they sing the 
song of Moses the servant of ELOHIYM, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great   
and marvellous are thy works, ADONAY EL SHADDAY; just and true are thy ways,    
thou King of saints.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Who shall not fear thee, O YHVH, and glorify thy name? for thou only art 
holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are 
made manifest.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>
And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the       
testimony in heaven was opened:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>

plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with  
golden girdles.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials     
full of the wrath of ELOHIYM, who liveth for ever and ever.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And the temple was filled with  
smoke from the glory of ELOHIYM, and from his power; and no man was able to     
enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were          
fulfilled.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M.
