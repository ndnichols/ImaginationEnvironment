east gate of YHVH's house, which looketh eastward: and behold at the door of    
the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and   
Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said he unto me, Son of man,   
these are the men that devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this         
city:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Which    
say, It is not near; let us build houses: this city is the caldron, and we be   
the flesh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And the Spirit of YHVH fell upon    
me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus saith YHVH; Thus have ye said, O house of     
Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind, every one of them.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye have           
multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with 
the slain.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Therefore thus saith the ADONAY YHVH; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst 
of it, they are the flesh, and this city is the caldron: but I will bring you   
forth out of the midst of it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>   
8</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you,  
saith the ADONAY YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into 
the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye shall fall by the sword; I 
will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I am YHVH.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>This city shall 
not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; but I  
will judge you in the border of Israel:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

the manners of the heathen that are round about you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, when I       
prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my     
face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah ADONAY YHVH! wilt thou make a   
full end of the remnant of Israel?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14> 
<H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Again the word of YHVH came unto me, saying,</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Son of man, thy      
brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of       
Israel wholly, are they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get   
you far from YHVH: unto us is this land given in possession.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore say, Thus saith the 
ADONAY YHVH; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although  
I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little    
sanctuary in the countries where they shall come.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore say, Thus saith the     
ADONAY YHVH; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of    
the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of     
Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things     
thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will give them one heart,   
and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of  
their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>That they may walk in my          
statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people,   
and I will be their ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>   
21</H4></TD><TD><P>But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their 
detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon      
their own heads, saith the ADONAY YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

the wheels beside them; and the glory of the ELOHIYM of Israel was over them    
above.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
the glory of YHVH went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the        
mountain which is on the east side of the city.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Afterwards the spirit took me up, and        
brought me in a vision by the Spirit of ELOHIYM into Chaldea, to them of the    
captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Then I spake unto them of the     
captivity all the things that YHVH had shewed me.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This
