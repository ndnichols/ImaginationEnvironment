<p>1. Now will I glorify Food that upholds great strength,<br> By whose invigorating power Trita rent V&#7771;tra limb from limb.<br> 2 O pleasant Food, O Food of meath, thee have we chosen for our own,<br> So be our kind protector thou.<br> 3 Come hitherward to us, O Food, auspicious with auspicious help,<br> Health-bringing, not unkind, a dear and guileless friend.<br> 4 These juices which, O Food, are thine throughout the regions are diffused.<br> like winds they have their place in heaven.<br> 5 These gifts of thine, O Food, O Food most sweet to taste,<br> These savours of thy juices work like creatures that have mighty necks.<br> 6 In thee, O Food, is set the spirit of great Gods.<br> Under thy flag brave deeds were done he slew the Dragon with thy help.<br> 7 If thou be gone unto the splendour of the clouds,<br> Even from thence, O Food of meath, prepared for our enjoyment, come.<br> 8 Whatever morsel we consume from waters or from plants of earth, O Soma, wax thou fat thereby.<br> 9 What Soma, we enjoy from thee in milky food or barley-brew, V&#257;t&#257;pi, grow thou fat thereby.<br> 10 O Vegetable, Cake of meal, he wholesome, firm, and strengthening: V&#257;t&#257;pi, grow thou fat thereby.<br> 11 O Food, from thee as such have we drawn forth with lauds, like cows, our sacrificial gifts,<br> From thee who banquetest with Gods, from thee who banquetest with us.</p>
