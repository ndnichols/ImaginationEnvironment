<p>1. I WILL extol the most heroic Indra who with his might forced earth and sky asunder;<br> Who hath filled all with width as man's Upholder, surpassing floods and rivers in his greatness.<br> 2 S&#363;rya is he: throughout the wide expanses shall Indra turn him, swift as car-wheels, hither,<br> Like a stream resting not but ever active he hath destroyed, with light, the black-hued darkness.<br> 3 To him I sing a holy prayer, incessant new, matchless, common to the earth and heaven,<br> Who marks, as they were backs, all living creatures: ne&#146;er doth he fail a friend, the noble Indra.<br> 4 I will send forth my songs in flow unceasing, like water from the ocean's depth, to Indra.<br> Who to his car on both its sides securely hath fixed the earth and heaven as with an axle.<br> 5 Rousing with draughts, the Shaker, rushing onward, impetuous, very strong, armed as with arrows<br> Is Soma; forest trees and all the bushes deceive not Indra with their offered likeness.<br> 6 Soma hath flowed to him whom naught can equal, the earth, the heavens, the firmament, the mountains,&#151;<br> When heightened in his ire his indignation shatters the firm and breaks the strong in pieces.<br> 7 As an axe fells the tree so be slew V&#7771;tra, brake down the strongholds and dug out the rivers.<br> He cleft the mountain like a new-made pitcher. Indra brought forth the kine with his Companions.<br> 8 Wise art thou, Punisher of guilt, O Indra. The sword lops limbs, thou smitest down the sinner,<br> The men who injure, as it were a comrade, the lofty Law of Varu&#7751;a and Mitra.<br> 9 Men who lead evil lives, who break agreements, and injure Varu&#7751;a, Aryaman and Mitra,&#151;<br> Against these foes, O Mighty Indra, sharpen, as furious death, thy Bull of fiery colour.<br> 10 Indra is Sovran Lord of Earth and Heaven, Indra is Lord of waters and of mountains.<br> Indra is Lord of prosperers and sages Indra must be invoked in rest and effort.<br> 11 Vaster than days and nights, Giver of increase, vaster than firmament and flood of ocean,<br> Vaster than bounds of earth and wind's extension, vaster than rivers and our lands is Indra.<br> 12 Forward, as herald of refulgent Morning, let thine insatiate arrow fly, O Indra.<br> And pierce, as &#146;twere a stone launched forth from heaven, with hottest blaze the men who love deception.<br> 13 Him, verily, the moons, the mountains followed, the tall trees followed and the plants and herbage.<br> Yearning with love both Worlds approached, the Waters waited on Indra when he first had being.<br> 14 Where was the vengeful dart when thou, O Indra, clavest the demon ever beat on outrage?<br> When fiends lay there upon the ground extended like cattle in the place of immolation?<br> 15 Those who are set in enmity against us, the Oga&#7751;as, O Indra, waxen mighty,&#151;<br> Let blinding darkness follow those our foemen, while these shall have bright shining nights to light them.<br> 16 May plentiful libations of the people, and singing &#7770;&#7779;is&#146; holy prayers rejoice thee.<br> Hearing with love this common invocation, come unto us, pass by all those who praise thee.<br> 17 O Indra, thus may we be made partakers of thy new favours that shall bring us profit.<br> Singing with love, may we the Vi&#347;v&#257;mitras win daylight even now through thee, O Indra.<br> 18 Call we on Maghavan, auspicious Indra, best hero in the fight where spoil is gathered,<br> The Strong who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the V&#7771;tras, wins and gathers riches.</p>
