<p>1. SING forth to him whom many men invoke, to him whom many laud.<br> Invite the powerful Indra with your songs of praise.<br> 2 Whose lofty might-for doubly strong is he-supports the heavens and earth,<br> And hills and plains and floods and light with manly power.<br> 3 Such, Praised by many! thou art King alone thou smitest V&#7771;tras dead,<br> To gain, O Indra, spoils of war and high renown.<br> 4 We sing this strong and wild delight of thine which conquers in the fray,<br> Which, Caster of the Stone! gives room and shines like gold.<br> 5 Wherewith thou also foundest lights for &#256;yu and for Manu's sake:<br> Now joying in this sacred grass thou beamest forth.<br> 6 This day too singers of the hymn praise, as of old, this might of thine:<br> Win thou the waters day by day, thralls of the strong.<br> 7 That lofty Indra-power of thine, thy strength and thine intelligence,<br> Thy thunderbolt for which we long, the wish makes keen.<br> 8 O Indra, Heaven and Earth augment thy manly power and thy renown;<br> The waters and thy mountains stir and urge thee on.<br> 9 Vi&#7779;&#7751;u the lofty ruling Power, Varu&#7751;a, Mitra sing thy praise:<br> In thee the Marut3' company have great delight.<br> 10 O Indra, thou wast born the Lord of men, most liberal of thy gifts:<br> Excellent deeds for evermore are all thine own.<br> 11 Ever, alone, O highly-praised, thou sendest V&#7771;tras to their rest:<br> None else than Indra executes the mighty deed.<br> 12 Though here and there, in varied hymns, Indra, men call on thee for aid,<br> Still with our heroes fight and win the light of heaven.<br> 13 Already have all forms of him entered our spacious dwelling-place:<br> For victory stir thou Indra, up, the Lord of Might.</p>
