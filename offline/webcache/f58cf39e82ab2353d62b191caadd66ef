<p>1. AGNI advances with his lofty banner: the Bull is bellowing to the earth and heavens.<br> He hath attained the sky's supremest limits. the Steer hath waxen in the lap of waters.<br> 2 The Bull, the youngling with the hump, hath frolicked, the strong and never-ceasing Calf hath bellowed.<br> Bringing our offerings to the God's assembly, he moves as Chief in his own dwelling-places.<br> 3 Him who hath grasped his Parents' head, they stablished at sacrifice a wave of heavenly lustre.<br> In his swift flight the red Dawns borne by horses refresh their bodies in the home of Order.<br> 4 For, Vasu thou precedest every Morning, and still hast been the Twins' illuminator.<br> For sacrifice, seven places thou retainest while for thine own self thou engenderest Mitra.<br> 5 Thou art the Eye and Guard of mighty Order, and Varu&#7751;a when to sacrifice thou comest.<br> Thou art the Waters&#146; Child O J&#257;tavedas, envoy of him whose offering thou acceptest.<br> 6 Thou art the Leader of the rite and region, to which with thine auspicious teams thou teadest,<br> Thy light-bestowing head to heaven thou liftest, making thy tongue the oblationbearer, Agni.<br> 7 Through his wise insight Trita in the cavern, seeking as ever the Chief Sire's intention,<br> Carefully tended in his Parents' bosom, calling the weapons kin, goes forth to combat.<br> 8 Well-skilled to use the weapons of his Father, &#256;ptya, urged on by Indra, fought the battle.<br> Then Trita slew the foe seven-rayed, three-headed, and freed the cattle of the Son of Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar.<br> 9 Lord of the brave, Indra cleft him in pieces who sought to gain much strength and deemed him mighty.<br> He smote his three heads from his body, seizing the cattle of the oniniform Son of Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar.</p>
