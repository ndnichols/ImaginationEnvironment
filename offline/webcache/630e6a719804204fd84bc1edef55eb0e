both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with   
harps.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And

gate:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And

Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And certain of the priests' sons  
with trumpets; namely, Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the

</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>And his         
brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah,  
Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of ELOHIYM, and Ezra the  
scribe before them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they went up by   
the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the house   
of David, even unto the water gate eastward.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall;</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>And from above the   
gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish gate, and the tower 
of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood    
still in the prison gate.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>

house of ELOHIYM, and I, and the half of the rulers with me:</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>And the priests; Eliakim,     
Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with           
trumpets;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and           
Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their  
overseer.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for ELOHIYM had made 
them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that  
the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>And at that time were some appointed over    
the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for 
the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of 
the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for 
the Levites that waited.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45><H4>45</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their         
ELOHIYM, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of      
David, and of Solomon his son.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46><H4> 
46</H4></TD><TD><P>For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief   
of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>47</H4></TD><TD><P>And all Israel in the     
days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the       
singers and the porters, every day his portion: and they sanctified holy things 
unto the Levites; and the Levites sanctified them unto the children of          
Aaron.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M.
