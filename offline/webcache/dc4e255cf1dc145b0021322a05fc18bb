Chapter 20</H1></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba,    
the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no     
part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to    
his tents, O Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed Sheba the  
son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan even to  
Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his       
concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and fed   
them, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their     
death, living in widowhood.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>     
4</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah     
within three days, and be thou here present.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but   
he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And David said to Abishai,  
Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou   
thy lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and   
escape us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites,   
and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba   
the son of Bichri.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went before  
them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded unto him, and upon it a  
girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he    
went forth it fell out.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And Joab    
took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>But Amasa took no heed to the     
sword that was in Joab's hand: so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and  
shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So    
Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And one of Joab's    
men stood by him, and said, He that favoreth Joab, and he that is for David,    
let him go after Joab.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when   
the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the        
highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one   
that came by him stood still.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>  
13</H4></TD><TD><P>When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went  
on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And he went through all the       
tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they   
were gathered together, and went also after him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And they came and besieged him in 
Abel of Bethmaachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in  
the trench: and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw  
it down.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto      
Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he was come near unto    
her, the woman said, Art thou Joab? And he answered, I am he. Then she said     
unto him, Hear the words of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Then she spake,      
saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask      
counsel at Abel: and so they ended the matter.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>I am one of them that are peaceable and      
faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why  
wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of YHVH?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far   
be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>The matter is not so: but a man   
of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand      
against the king, even against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from  
the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to     
thee over the wall.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off  
the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab. And he blew a     
trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab        
returned to Jerusalem unto the king.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and   
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the               
Pelethites:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was          
recorder:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And Ira also the Jairite was  
a chief ruler about David.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright
