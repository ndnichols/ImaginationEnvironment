<p>1. THE glorious Agni have I praised, and worshipped with. the sacred food.<br> May Agni deck the Gods for us. Between both gathering-places he goes on his embassy, the Sage. May all the others die away.<br> 2 Agni, burn down the word within their bodies through our newest speech,<br> All hatreds of the godless, all the wicked man's malignities. Away let the destroyers go. May all the others die away.<br> 3 Agni, I offer hymns to thee, like holy oil within thy mouth.<br> Acknowledge them. among the Gods, for thou art the most excellent, the worshipper's blissful messenger. Let all the others die away.<br> 4 Agni bestows all vital power even as each man supplicates.<br> He brings the Vasus strengthening gifts, and grants delight, in rest and stir, for every calling on the Gods. Let all the others die away.<br> 5 Agni hath made himself renowned by wonderful victorious act.<br> He is the Priest of all the tribes, chosen with sacrificial meeds. He urges Deities to receive. Let all the others die away.<br> 6 Agni knows all that springs from Gods, he knows the mystery of men.<br> Giver of wealth is Agni, he uncloses both the doors to us when worshipped with our newest gift. Let all the others die away.<br> 7 Agni inhabiteth with Gods and men who offer sacrifice.<br> He cherisheth with great delight much wisdom, as all things that be, God among Gods adorable. May all the others die away.<br> 8 Agni who liveth in all streams, Lord of the Sevenfold Race of men,<br> Him dweller in three homes we seek, best slayer of the Dasyus for Mandh&#257;tar, first in sacrifice. Let all the others die away.<br> 9 Agni the Wise inhabiteth three gathering-places, triply formed.<br> Decked as our envoy let the Sage bring hither and conciliate the Thrice Eleven Deities. Let all the others die away.<br> 10 Our Agni, thou art first among the Gods, and first mid living men.<br> Thou only rulest over wealth. Round about thee, as natural dams, circumfluous the waters run. Let all the others die away.</p>
