<p>1. STREWN is the sacred grass; come V&#257;yu, to our feast, with team of thousands, come, Lord of the harnessed team, with hundreds, Lord of harnessed steeds!<br> The drops divine are lifted up for thee, the God, to drink them first.<br> The juices rich in sweets have raised them for thy joy, have raised themselves to give thee strength.<br> 2 Purified by the stones the Soma flows for thee, clothed with its lovely splendours, to the reservoir, flows clad in its refulgent light.<br> For thee the Soma is poured forth, thy portioned share mid Gods and men.<br> Drive thou thy horses, V&#257;yu, come to us with love, come well-inclined and loving us.<br> 3 Come thou with hundreds, come with thousands in thy team to this our solemn rite, to taste the sacred food, V&#257;yu, to taste the offerings.<br> This is thy seasonable share, that comes co-radiant with the Sun.<br> Brought by attendant priests pure juice is offered up, V&#257;yu, pure juice is offered up.<br> 4 The chariot with its team of horses bring you both, to guard us and to taste the well-appointed food, V&#257;yu, to taste the offerings!<br> Drink of the pleasant-flavoured juice: the first draught is assigned to you.<br> O V&#257;yu, with your splendid bounty come ye both, Indra, with bounty come ye both.<br> 5 May our songs bring you hither to our solemn rites: these drops of mighty vigour have they beautified, like a swift steed of mighty strength.<br> Drink of them well-inclined to us, come hitherward to be our help.<br> Drink, Indra-V&#257;yu, of these Juices pressed with stones, Strength-givers! till they gladden you.<br> 6 These Soma juices pressed for you in waters here, borne by attendant priests, are offered up to you: bright, V&#257;yu, are they offered up.<br> Swift through the strainer have they flowed, and here are shed for both of you,<br> Soma-drops, fain for you, over the wether's fleece, Somas over the wether's fleece.<br> 7 O V&#257;yu, pass thou over all the slumberers, and where the press-stone rings enter ye both that house, yea, Indra, go ye both within.<br> The joyous Maiden is beheld, the butter flows. With richly laden team come to our solemn rite, yea, Indra, come ye to the rite.<br> 8 Ride hither to the offering of the pleasant juice, the holy Fig-tree which victorious priests surround: victorious be they still for us.<br> At once the cows yield milk, the barley-meal is dressed. For thee,<br> O V&#257;yu, never shall the cows grow thin, never for thee shall they be dry.<br> 9 These Bulls of thine, O V&#257;yu with the arm of strength, who swiftly fly within the current of thy stream, the Bulls increasing in their might,<br> Horseless, yet even through the waste swift-moving, whom no shout can stay,<br> Hard to be checked are they, like sunbeams, in their course. hard to be checked by both the hands.</p>
