<p>1. COMING at early morn he gives his treasure; the prudent one receives and entertains him.<br> Thereby increasing still his life and offspring, he comes with brave sons to abundant riches.<br> 2 Rich shall he be in gold and kine and horses. Indra bestows on him great vital power,<br> Who stays thee, as thou comest, with his treasure, like game caught in the net, O early comer.<br> 3 Longing, I came this morning to the pious, the son of sacrifice, with car wealth-laden.<br> Give him to drink juice of the stalk that gladdens; prosper with pleasant hymns the Lord of Heroes.<br> 4 Health-bringing streams, as milch-cows, flow to profit him who hath worshipped, him who now will worship.<br> To him who freely gives and fills on all sides full streams of fatness flow and make him famous.<br> 5 On the high ridge of heaven he stands exalted, yea, to the Gods he goes, the liberal giver.<br> The streams, the waters flow for him with fatness: to him this guerdon ever yields abundance.<br> 6 For those who give rich meeds are all these splendours, for those who give rich meeds suns shine in heaven.<br> The givers of rich meeds are made immortal; the givers of rich fees prolong their lifetime.<br> 7 Let not the liberal sink to sin and sorrow, never decay the pious chiefs who worship!<br> Let every man besides be their protection, and let affliction fall upon the niggard.</p>
