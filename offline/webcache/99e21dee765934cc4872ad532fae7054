NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>And he commanded the steward of his house,        
saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put      
every man's money in his sack's mouth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's     
mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word     
that Joseph had spoken.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and  
their asses.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto  
his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say    
unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Is not this it in which my lord     
drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And he overtook   
them, and he spake unto them these same words.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my     
lord these words? Forbid that thy servants should do according to this          
thing:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Behold, 
the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out  
of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver  
or gold?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>With  
whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be   
my lord's bondmen.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom  
it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Then they speedily took down  
every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And he searched, and      
began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in         
Benjamin's sack.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned  
to the city.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>
And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and    
they fell before him on the ground.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15>
<H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye     
have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And Judah said, What      
shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear           
ourselves? ELOHIYM hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are  
my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, forbid  
that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my 
servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Judah came near unto     
him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my     
lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art     
even as Pharaoh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And we said     
unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a       
little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and    
his father loveth him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I   
may set mine eyes upon him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>    
22</H4></TD><TD><P>And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father:   
for if he should leave his father, his father would die.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And thou saidst unto thy          
servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face 
no more.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the     
words of my lord.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And we said, We cannot go 
down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not  
see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And thy servant my father     
said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And the one went out from me, and 
I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And if ye take this also from 
me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to   
the grave.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; 
seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>It shall come to pass, when he    
seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall     
bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the          
grave.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>For   
thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him    
not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>Now therefore, I pray     
thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let    
the lad go up with his brethren.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34>   
<H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not   
with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.</P></TD>
