1</H4></TD><TD><P>The hand of YHVH was upon me, and carried me out in the       
spirit of YHVH, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of    
bones,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And     
caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the 
open valley; and, lo, they were very dry.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones  
live? And I answered, O ADONAY YHVH, thou knowest.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Again he said unto me, Prophesy     
upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of YHVH.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus saith the    
ADONAY YHVH unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you,    
and ye shall live:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and    
cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall     
know that I am YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a     
noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And when I        
beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered    
them above: but there was no breath in them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind,     
prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH; Come     
from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may      
live.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>So I   
prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived,   
and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Then he said unto me, Son of man, 
these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are      
dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore prophesy and say unto   
them, Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, 
and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of     
Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
ye shall know that I am YHVH, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and  
brought you up out of your graves,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14> 
<H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I 
shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I YHVH have spoken    
it, and performed it, saith the ADONAY.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>The word of YHVH came again unto me, saying,</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover, thou  
son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the      
children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it,  
For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim and for all the house of Israel his            
companions:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine 
hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not    
shew us what thou meanest by these?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19>
<H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Say unto them, Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH; Behold, I     
will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes  
of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of       
Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And the sticks       
whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And say unto them, Thus saith 
the ADONAY YHVH; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the      
heathen, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring    
them into their own land:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>      
22</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will make them one nation in the land upon the         
mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be  
no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more   
at all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>     
Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their  
detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them   
out of all their dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse     
them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And David my servant shall be 
king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in   
my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And they shall dwell in the land  
that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and   
they shall dwell therein, even they, and their children, and their children's   
children for ever: and my servant David shall be their prince for ever.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover I will make 
a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them:   
and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the      
midst of them for evermore.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>
