NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>Now the children of Reuben and the children of    
Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer,  
and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle;</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>The children of Gad    
and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar the        
priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and  
Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Even the country which YHVH 
smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants 
have cattle:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be     
given unto thy servants for a possession, and bring us not over Jordan.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses said unto    
the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to    
war, and shall ye sit here?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>     
7</H4></TD><TD><P>And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of      
Israel from going over into the land which YHVH hath given them?</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus did your fathers, when 
I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>For when they went up unto the valley of       
Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, 
that they should not go into the land which YHVH had given them.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH's anger was      
kindled the same time, and he sware, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Surely none of the men that came up out of      
Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto  
Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed      
me:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Save     
Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they    
have wholly followed YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>     
13</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made     
them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had   
done evil in the sight of YHVH, was consumed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And, behold, ye are risen up in your         
fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of   
YHVH toward Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD>
<TD><P>For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the  
wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And they came near unto him, and  
said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little   
ones:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>But we 
ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have      
brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced    
cities because of the inhabitants of the land.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>We will not return unto our houses, until    
the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>For we will not inherit   
with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance is fallen  
to us on this side Jordan eastward.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20>
<H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if   
ye will go armed before YHVH to war,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And will go all of you armed over Jordan before 
YHVH, until he hath driven out his enemies from before him,</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And the land be subdued       
before YHVH: then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before YHVH, and  
before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before YHVH.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>But if ye will not do so, 
behold, ye have sinned against YHVH: and be sure your sin will find you out.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Build you       
cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath   
proceeded out of your mouth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>   
25</H4></TD><TD><P>And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake     
unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>Our little ones, our

Gilead:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>But  
thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before YHVH to battle, as 
my lord saith.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of 
Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel:</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses said unto  
them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over 
Jordan, every man armed to battle, before YHVH, and the land shall be subdued   
before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>But if they     
will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the 
land of Canaan.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As YHVH 
hath said unto thy servants, so will we do.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>We will pass over armed before YHVH into the    
land of Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may  
be ours.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of

Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land,     
with the cities thereof in the coasts, even the cities of the country round     
about.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

<P>And Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds for sheep.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And the children of

<P>And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it,
