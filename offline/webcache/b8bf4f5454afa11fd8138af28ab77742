Chapter 16</H1></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which 
had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his         
goods.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And he  
called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an      
account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the steward said       
within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the            
stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put  
out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>So he called every one of his   
lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my   
lord?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And he   
said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit  
down quickly, and write fifty.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>  
7</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he      
said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and    
write fourscore.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for   
the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of   
light.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And I   
say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness;      
that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>He that is faithful  
in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the   
least is unjust also in much.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>  
11</H4></TD><TD><P>If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous    
mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And if ye have not been faithful  
in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>No servant can  
serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else 
he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve ELOHIYM and     
mammon.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided 
him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And he  
said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but ELOHIYM    
knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination 
in the sight of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4>
</TD><TD><P>The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the       
kingdom of EL is preached, and every man presseth into it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And it is easier for heaven and   
earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Whosoever putteth away his wife,  
and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is   
put away from her husband committeth adultery.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>There was a certain rich man, which was      
clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And there was a certain   
beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And desiring to be fed    
with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came    
and licked his sores.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the   
angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And in hell he lift  
up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his  
bosom.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he  
may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented  
in this flame.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy     
good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and     
thou art tormented.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so  
that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to   
us, that would come from thence.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27>   
<H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou   
wouldest send him to my father's house:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>For I have five brethren; that he may testify   
unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Abraham saith unto him, They have 
Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one    
went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses 
and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the      
dead.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M. Hurt,
