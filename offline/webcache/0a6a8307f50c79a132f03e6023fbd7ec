<p>1. THE car that was not made for horses or for reins, three-wheeled, worthy of lauds, rolls round the firmament.<br> That is the great announcement of your Deity, that, O ye &#7770;bhus, ye sustain the earth and heaven.<br> 2 Ye Sapient Ones who made the lightly-rolling car out of your mind, by thought, the car that never errs,<br> You, being such, to drink of this drink-offering, you, O ye V&#257;jas, and ye &#7770;bhus, we invoke.<br> 3 O V&#257;jas, &#7770;bhus, reaching far, among the Gods this was your exaltation gloriously declared,<br> In that your aged Parents, worn with length of days, ye wrought again to youth so that they moved at will.<br> 4 The chalice that wag single ye have made fourfold, and by your wisdom brought the Cow forth from the hide.<br> So quickly, mid the Gods, ye gained immortal life. V&#257;jas and &#7770;bhus, your great work must be extolled.<br> 5 Wealth from the &#7770;bhus is most glorious in renown, that which the Heroes, famed for vigour, have produced.<br> In synods must be sung the car which Vibhvan wrought: that which ye favour, Gods! is famed among mankind.<br> 6 Strong is the steed, the man a sage in eloquence, the bowman is a hero hard to beat in fight,<br> Great store of wealth and manly power hath he obtained whom V&#257;ja, Vibhvan, &#7770;bhus have looked kindly on.<br> 7 To you hath been assigned the fairest ornament, the hymn of praise: V&#257;jas and &#7770;bhus, joy therein;<br> For ye have lore and wisdom and poetic skill: as such, with this our prayer we call on you to come.<br> 8 According to the wishes of our hearts may ye, who have full knowledge of all the delights of men,<br> Fashion for us, O &#7770;bhus, power and splendid wealth, rich in high courage, excellent, and vital strength.<br> 9 Bestowing on us here riches and offspring, here fashion fame for us befitting heroes.<br> Vouchsafe us wealth of splendid sort, O &#7770;bhus, that we may make us more renowned than others.</p>
