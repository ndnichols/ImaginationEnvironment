<p>1 Thou, Agni, wast the earliest A&#7749;giras, a Seer; thou wast, a God thyself, the Gods&#146; auspicious Friend.<br> After thy holy ordinance the Maruts, sage, active through wisdom, with their glittering spears, were born.<br> 2 O Agni, thou, the best and earliest A&#7749;giras, fulfillest as a Sage the holy law of Gods.<br> Sprung from two mothers, wise, through all existence spread, resting in many a place for sake of living man.<br> 3 To M&#257;tari&#347;van first thou, Agni, wast disclosed, and to Vivasv&#257;n through thy noble inward power.<br> Heaven and Earth, Vasu! shook at the choosing of the Priest: the burthen thou didst bear, didst worship mighty Gods.<br> 4 Agni thou madest heaven to thunder for mankind; thou, yet more pious, for pious Pur&#363;ravas.<br> When thou art rapidly freed from thy parents, first eastward they bear thee round, and, after, to the west.<br> 5 Thou, Agni, art a Bull who makes our store increase, to be invoked by him who lifts the ladle up.<br> Well knowing the oblation with the hallowing word, uniting all who live, thou lightenest first our folk<br> 6 Agni, thou savest in the synod when pursued e&#146;en him, farseeing One! who walks in evil ways.<br> Thou, when the heroes fight for spoil which men rush, round, slayest in war the many by the hands of few.<br> 7 For glory, Agni, day by day, thou liftest up the mortal man to highest immortality,<br> Even thou who yearning for both races givest them great bliss, and to the prince grantest abundant food.<br> 8 O Agni, highly lauded, make our singer famous that he may win us store of riches:<br> May we improve the rite with new performance. O Earth and Heaven, with all the Gods, protect us.<br> 9 O blameless Agni lying in thy Parents' lap, a God among the Gods, be watchful for our good.<br> Former of bodies, be the singer's Providence: all good things hast thou sown for him, auspicious One!<br> 10 Agni, thou art our Providence, our Father thou: we are thy brethren and thou art our spring of life.<br> In thee, rich in good heroes, guard of high decrees, meet hundred, thousand treasures, O infallible!<br> 11 Thee, Agni, have the Gods made the first living One for living man, Lord of the house of Nahu&#7779;a.<br> I&#7735;&#257; they made the teacher of the sons of men, what time a Son was born to the father of my race.<br> 12 Worthy to be revered, O Agni, God, preserve our wealthy patrons with thy succours, and ourselves.<br> Guard of our seed art thou, aiding our cows to bear, incessantly protecting in thy holy way.<br> 13 Agni, thou art a guard close to the pious man; kindled art thou, four-eyed! for him who is unarmed.<br> With fond heart thou acceptest e&#146;en the poor man's prayer, when he hath brought his gift to gain security.<br> 14 Thou, Agni gainest for the loudly-praising priest the highest wealth, the object of a man's desire.<br> Thou art called Father, caring even for the weak, and wisest, to the simple one thou teachest lore.<br> 15 Agni, the man who giveth guerdon to the priests, like well-sewn armour thou guardest on every side.<br> He who with grateful food shows kindness in his house, an offerer to the living, is the type of heaven.<br> 16 Pardon, we pray, this sin of ours, O Agni,&#151;the path which we have trodden, widely straying,<br> Dear Friend and Father, caring for the pious, who speedest nigh and who inspirest mortals.<br> 17 As erst to Manus, to Yay&#257;ti, A&#7749;giras, so A&#7749;giras! pure Agni! come thou to our hall.<br> Bring hither the celestial host and seat them here upon the sacred grass, and offer what they love.<br> 18 By this our prayer be thou, O Agni, strengthened, prayer made by us after our power and knowledge.<br> Lead thou us, therefore, to increasing riches; endow us with thy strength-bestowing favour.</p>
