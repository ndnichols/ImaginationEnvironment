<p>1. GLADDEN the yearning Gods, O thou Most Youthful: bring them, O Lord of Seasons, knowing seasons,<br> With all the Priests Celestial, O Agni. Best worshipper art thou of all Invokers.<br> 2 Thine is the Herald's, thine the Cleanser's office, thinker art thou, wealth-giver, true to Order.<br> Let us with Sv&#257;h&#257; offer up oblations, and Agni, worthy God, pay the Gods worship.<br> 3 To the Gods&#146; pathway have we travelled, ready to execute what work we may accomplish.<br> Let Agni, for he knows, complete the worship. He is the Priest: let him fix rites and seasons.<br> 4 When we most ignorant neglect the statutes of you, O Deities with whom is knowledge,<br> Wise Agni shall correct our faults and failings, skilled to assign each God his fitting season.<br> 5 When, weak in mind, of feeble understanding, mortals bethink them not of sacrificing,<br> Then shall the prudent and discerning Agni worship the Gods, best worshipper, in season.<br> 6 Because the Father hath produced thee, Leader of all our solemn rites, their brilliant Banner:<br> So win by worship pleasant homes abounding in heroes, and rich food to nourish all men.<br> 7 Thou whom the Heaven and Earth, thou whom the Waters, and Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar, maker of fair things, created,<br> Well knowing, all along the Fathers' pathway, shine with resplendent light, enkindled, Agni.</p>
