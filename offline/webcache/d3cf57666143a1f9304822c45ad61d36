<p>1. PREPARE oblation: let him come; and let the minister serve again<br> Who knows the ordering thereof,<br> 2 Rejoicing in his friendship, let the priest be seated over man,<br> Beside the shoot of active power.<br> 3 Him, glowing bright beyond all thought, they seek among the race of man;<br> With him for <A HREF="errata.htm#24">tongue</A> they seize the food.<br> 4 He hath inflamed the twofold plain: life-giving, he hath climbed the wood,<br> And with his tongue hath struck the rock.<br> 5 Wandering here the radiant Calf finds none to fetter him, and seeks<br> The Mother to declare his praise.<br> 6 And now that great and mighty team, the team of horses that are his,<br> And traces of his car, are seen.<br> 7 The seven milk a single cow; the two set other five to work,<br> On the stream's loud-resounding bank.<br> 8 Entreated by Vivasv&#257;n's ten, Indra cast down the water-jar<br> With threefold hammer from the sky.<br> 9 Three times the newly-kindled flame proceeds around the sacrifice:<br> The priests anoint it with the meath.<br> 10 With reverence they drain the fount that circles with its wheel above,<br> Exhaustless, with the mouth below.<br> 11 The pressing-stones are set at work: the meath is poured into the tank,<br> At the out-shedding of the fount.<br> 12 Ye cows, protect the fount: the two Mighty Ones bless the sacrifice.<br> The handles twain are wrought of gold.<br> 13 Pour on the juice the ornament which reaches both the heaven and earth<br> Supply the liquid to the Bull.<br> 14 These know their own abiding-place: like calves beside the mother cows<br> They meet together with their kin.<br> 15 Devouring in their greedy jaws, they make sustaining food in heaven,<br> To Indra, Agni light and prayer.<br> 16 The Pious One milked out rich food, sustenance dealt in portions seven,<br> Together with the Sun's seven rays.<br> 17 I took some Soma when the Sun rose up, O Mitra, Varu&#7751;a.<br> That is the sick man's medicine.<br> 18 From where oblations must be laid, which is the Well-beloved's home,<br> He with his tongue hath compassed heaven.</p>
