<p>1. THUS in the Soma, in wild joy the Brahman hath exalted thee:<br> Thou, mightiest thunder-armed, hast driven by force the Dragon from the earth, lauding thine own imperial sway.<br> 2 The mighty flowing Soma-draught, brought by the Hawk, hath gladdened thee,<br> That in thy strength, O Thunderer, thou hast struck down V&#7771;tra from the floods, lauding thine own imperial sway.<br> 3 Go forward, meet the foe, be bold; thy bolt of thunder is not checked.<br> Manliness, Indra, is thy might: stay V&#7771;tra, make the waters thine, lauding thine own imperial sway.<br> 4 Thou smotest V&#7771;tra from the earth, smotest him, Indra, from the sky.<br> Let these life-fostering waters flow attended by the Marut host, lauding thine own imperial sway.<br> 5 The wrathful Indra with his bolt of thunder rushing on the foe,<br> Smote fierce on trembling V&#7771;tra's back, and loosed the waters free to run, lauding his own imperial sway.<br> 6 With hundred-jointed thunderbolt Indra hath struck him on the back,<br> And, while rejoicing in the juice, seeketh prosperity for friends, lauding his own imperial sway.<br> 7 Indra, unconquered might is thine, Thunderer, Caster of the Stone;<br> For thou with thy surpassing power smotest to death the guileful beast, lauding thine own imperial sway.<br> 8 Far over ninety spacious floods thy thunderbolts were cast abroad:<br> Great, Indra, is thy hero might, and strength is seated in thine arms, lauding thine own imperial sway.<br> 9 Laud him a thousand all at once, shout twenty forth the hymn of praise.<br> Hundreds have sung aloud to him, to Indra hath the prayer been raised, lauding his own imperial sway.<br> 10 Indra hath smitten down the power of V&#7771;tra,&#151;might with stronger might.<br> This was his manly exploit, he slew V&#7771;tra and let loose the floods, lauding his own imperial sway.<br> 11 Yea, even this great Pair of Worlds trembled in terror at thy wrath,<br> When, Indra, Thunderer, Marut-girt, thou slewest V&#7771;tra in thy strength, lauding thine own imperial sway.<br> 12 But V&#7771;tra scared not Indra with his shaking or his thunder roar.<br> On him that iron thunderbolt fell fiercely with its thousand points, lauding his own imperial sway.<br> 13 When with the thunder thou didst make thy dart and V&#7771;tra meet in war,<br> Thy might, O Indra, fain to slay the Dragon, was set firm in heaven, lauding thine own imperial sway.<br> 14 When at thy shout, O Thunder-armed, each thing both fixed and moving shook,<br> E&#146;en Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar trembled at thy wrath and quaked with fear because of thee, lauding thine own imperial sway.<br> 15 There is not, in our knowledge, one who passeth Indra in his strength:<br> In him the Deities have stored manliness, insight, power and might, lauding his own imperial sway.<br> 16 Still as of old, whatever rite Atharvan, Manus sire of all,<br> Dadhyach performed, their prayer and praise united in that Indra meet, lauding his own imperial sway.</p>
