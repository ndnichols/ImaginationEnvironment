Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel      
asked YHVH, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to     
fight against them?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And YHVH said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into 
his hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may    
fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So 
Simeon went with him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And Judah went up; and YHVH delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites  
into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And they found Adonibezek   
in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the     
Perizzites.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>   
But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off    
his thumbs and his great toes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>  
7</H4></TD><TD><P>And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their   
thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I   
have done, so ELOHIYM hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and  
there he died.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>
Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and   
smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And afterward the children  
of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, 
and in the south, and in the valley.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And Judah went against the Canaanites that      
dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew 
Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11>   
<H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And from thence he went against the inhabitants of       
Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And Caleb said, He that smiteth   
Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And Othniel the 
son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his      
daughter to wife.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of  
her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb said unto her,  
What wilt thou?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south    
land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and   
the nether springs.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the 
city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah,     
which lieth in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And Judah went  
with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath,

</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Also Judah took Gaza 
with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the  
coast thereof.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And YHVH was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain;   
but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had         
chariots of iron.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled thence   
the three sons of Anak.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that

Jerusalem unto this day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and YHVH 
was with them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD>

before was Luz.)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto   
him, Show us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will show thee   
mercy.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
when he showed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the    
edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And the man went into the     
land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which  
is the name thereof unto this day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27> 
<H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of        
Bethshean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor

of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass,
