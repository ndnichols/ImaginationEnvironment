1</H4></TD><TD><P>Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, 
which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And five of them were wise, and 
five were foolish.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>But the wise took 
oil in their vessels with their lamps.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered  
and slept.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to   
meet him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Then 
all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And the foolish said unto the wise, 
Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>But the wise answered, saying, Not  
so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that      
sell, and buy for yourselves.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>  
10</H4></TD><TD><P>And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they    
that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Afterward came  
also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>But he answered and said, Verily  
I say unto you, I know you not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>
13</H4></TD><TD><P>Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour    
wherein the Son of man cometh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4> 
14</H4></TD><TD><P>For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far  
country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And unto one he 
gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according   
to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Then he that had received the     
five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five            
talents.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>But he that had received one  
went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>After a long time the lord of     
those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And so he that had received five talents     
came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me     
five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>His lord said unto him,   
Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few   
things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy 
lord.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>He     
also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto   
me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>His lord said unto   
him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few

lord.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Then   
he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou 
art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou     
hast not strawed:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there    
thou hast that is thine.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4>
</TD><TD><P>His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful       
servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have    
not strawed:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>
Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my  
coming I should have received mine own with usury.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Take therefore the talent from    
him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>For unto every one that hath      
shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall   
be taken away even that which he hath.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>When the Son of man shall come in 
his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne  
of his glory:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one 
from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And he shall set the sheep on 
his right hand, but the goats on the left.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

the foundation of the world:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>

sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>Then shall the righteous      
answer him, saying, ADONAY, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or       
thirsty, and gave thee drink?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>

<P>Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>And the King shall answer and
