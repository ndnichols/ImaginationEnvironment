<p>1. WITH constant succours, fain thyself to share it, make this oblation which we bring effective.<br> Grown great through strengthening gifts at each libation, he hath become renowned by mighty exploits.<br> 2 For Indra were the Somas erst- discovered, whereby he grew strong-jointed, vast, and skilful.<br> Indra , take quickly these presented juices: drink of the strong, that which the strong have shaken.<br> 3 Drink and wax great. Thine are the juices, Indra, both Somas of old time and these we bring thee.<br> Even as thou drankest, Indra, earlier Somas, so drink to-day, a new guest, meet for praises.<br> 4 Great and impetuous, mighty-voiced in battle, surpassing power is his, and strength resistless.<br> Him the broad earth hath never comprehended when Somas cheered the Lord of Tawny Coursers.<br> 5 Mighty and strong he waxed for hero exploit: the Bull was furnished a Sage's wisdom.<br> Indra is our kind Lord; his steers have vigour; his cows are many with abundant offspring.<br> 6 As floods according to their stream flow onward, so to the sea, as borne on cars, the waters.<br> Vaster is Indra even than his dwelling, what time the stalk milked out, the Soma, fills him.<br> 7 Eager to mingle with the sea, the rivers carry the well-pressed Soma juice to Indra.<br> They drain the stalk out with their arms, quick-banded, and cleanse it with a stream of mead and filters.<br> 8 Like lakes appear his flanks filled full with Soma: yea, he contains libations in abundance.<br> When Indra had consumed the first sweet viands, he, after slaying V&#7771;tra, claimed the Soma.<br> 9 Then bring thou hither, and let none prevent it: we know thee well, the Lord of wealth and treasure.<br> That splendid gift which is thine own, O Indra, vouchsafe to us, Lord of the Tawny Coursers.<br> 10 O Indra, Maghavan, impetuous mover, grant us abundant wealth that brings all blessings.<br> Give us a hundred autumns for our lifetime: give us, O fair-checked Indra, store of heroes.<br> 11 Call we on Indra, Maghavan, auspicious, best Hero in the fight where spoil is gathered,<br> The Strong, who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the V&#7771;tras, wins and gathers riches.</p>
