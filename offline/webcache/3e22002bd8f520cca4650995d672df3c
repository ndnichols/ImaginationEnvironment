Chapter 7</H1></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished   
all his house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>
He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an     
hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof    
thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the       
pillars.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on forty five pillars, 
fifteen in a row.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light in three   
ranks.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And all 
the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and light was against light  
in three ranks.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the 
breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was before them: and the other     
pillars and the thick beam were before them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Then he made a porch for the throne where he      
might judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one 
side of the floor to the other.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4> 
8</H4></TD><TD><P>And his house where he dwelt had another court within the     
porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh's     
daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>All these were of costly stones,    
according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, 
even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the      
great court.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>
And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten       
cubits, and stones of eight cubits.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11>
<H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And above were costly stones, after the measures of      
hewed stones, and cedars.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>      
12</H4></TD><TD><P>And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed 
stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of      
YHVH, and for the porch of the house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of  
Tyre.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>He was 
a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a     
worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning  
to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his    
work.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>For he 
cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve 
cubits did compass either of them about.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to   
set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five       
cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits:</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And nets of checker work, and 
wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which were upon the top of the         
pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And he made the      
pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters  
that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other          
chapiter.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in    
the porch, four cubits.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, 
over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two  
hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And he set up the pillars in the  
porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name        
thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof      
Boaz.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars       
finished.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was     
round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits    
did compass it round about.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>    
24</H4></TD><TD><P>And under the brim of it round about there were knops        
compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were   
cast in two rows, when it was cast.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25>
<H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the      
north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south,   
and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all 
their hinder parts were inward.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>
26</H4></TD><TD><P>And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was   
wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two        
thousand baths.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and  
four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And the work of the  
bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the    
ledges:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim: and 
upon the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were     
certain additions made of thin work.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And every base had four brazen wheels, and      
plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver 
were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And the mouth of it within the    
chapiter and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round after the work  
of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings   
with their borders, foursquare, not round.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And under the borders were four wheels; and the 
axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was  
a cubit and half a cubit.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>      
33</H4></TD><TD><P>And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot    
wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes,   
were all molten.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base: and    
the undersetters were of the very base itself.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And in the top of the base was there a round 
compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and 
the borders thereof were of the same.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on 
the borders thereof, he graved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to    
the proportion of every one, and additions round about.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>After this manner he made the ten 
bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>Then made he ten lavers of    
brass: one laver contained forty baths: and every laver was four cubits: and    
upon every one of the ten bases one laver.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>And he put five bases on the right side of the  
house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right  
side of the house eastward over against the south.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>And Hiram made the lavers, and    
the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he 
made king Solomon for the house of YHVH:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>The two pillars, and the two bowls of the       
chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to     
cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars;</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>And four        
hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of pomegranates for    
one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the         
pillars;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P>And the pots,   
and the shovels, and the basins: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to     
king Solomon for the house of YHVH, were of bright brass.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46><H4>46</H4></TD><TD><P>In the plain of Jordan did the    
king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>47</H4></TD><TD><P>And Solomon left all the  
vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of  
the brass found out.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V48><H4>48</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of   
YHVH: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread was,</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V49><H4>49</H4></TD><TD><P>And the         
candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the left, before 
the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold,</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V50><H4>50</H4></TD><TD><P>And the bowls, and   
the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and 
the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, 
and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V51><H4>51</H4></TD><TD><P>So was ended all the work that    
king Solomon made for the house of YHVH. And Solomon brought in the things      
which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the    
vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of YHVH.</P></TD></TR>
