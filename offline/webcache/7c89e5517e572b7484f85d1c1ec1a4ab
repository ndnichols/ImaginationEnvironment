YHVH: and YHVH heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of YHVH burnt  
among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp.</P>

multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also   
wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>We remember the fish, which we did

onions, and the garlic:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4>

this manna, before our eyes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>

the color of bdellium.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills,

the burden of all this people upon me?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

their fathers?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto  
me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

wretchedness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And YHVH said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of        
Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over     
them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may     
stand there with thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4>

the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.</P>

unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: 
for ye have wept in the ears of YHVH, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat?   
for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore YHVH will give you flesh, and ye    
shall eat.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor

But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome 
unto you: because that ye have despised YHVH which is among you, and have wept  
before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

and spake unto him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto  
the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon      
them, they prophesied, and did not cease.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>But there remained two of the men in the camp,  
the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit  
rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out     
unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And there ran a young man, and    
told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And Joshua the son of Nun,    
the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses,   
forbid them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>
And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would that all YHVH's people 
were prophets, and that YHVH would put his spirit upon them!</P></TD></TR><TR>

camp, he and the elders of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31> 
<H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And there went forth a wind from YHVH, and brought       
quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey  
on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the 
camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And the people stood up   
all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the   
quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all    
abroad for themselves round about the camp.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

YHVH smote the people with a very great plague.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>And he called the name of that place
