him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with    
pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's   
brink.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And his 
sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And the daughter of Pharaoh came    
down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's

it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And when

Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women,

he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And he looked this way and

thy fellow?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill 
me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this      
thing is known.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD>
<P>Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled   
from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a 
well.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Now    
the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and     
filled the troughs to water their father's flock.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day?</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And they said,  
An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water  
enough for us, and watered the flock.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses was

<P>And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the

cry came up unto ELOHIYM by reason of the bondage.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD
