1</H4></TD><TD><P>Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that    
seek YHVH: look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit    
whence ye are digged.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you: for I       
called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>For YHVH shall comfort Zion: he     
will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden,   
and her desert like the garden of YHVH; joy and gladness shall be found         
therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto  
me, O my nation: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment   
to rest for a light of the people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5>  
<H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and 
mine arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and on mine arm 
shall they trust.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD>
<P>Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the   
heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a        
garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation 
shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Hearken unto me, ye that    
know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the        
reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>For the moth shall eat them up like 
a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be 
for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Awake, awake, put on strength, O    
arm of YHVH; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou 
not it that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Art thou not it which hath dried  
the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a   
way for the ransomed to pass over?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11> 
<H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore the redeemed of YHVH shall return, and come    
with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head: they      
shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>I, even I, am he     
that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that  
shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass;</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And forgettest YHVH thy       
maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the   
earth; and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the         
oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the         
oppressor?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>  
The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he should not die

Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of YHVH the   
cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung 
them out.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>   
There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth;      
neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she hath  
brought up.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P> 
These two things are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for thee? desolation,   
and destruction, and the famine, and the sword: by whom shall I comfort         
thee?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Thy    
sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as a wild bull in a

thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus saith thy ADOWN YHVH, and thy ELOHIYM   
that pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand   
the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more  
drink it again:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD>
<P>But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; which have said   
to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the  
ground, and as the street, to them that went over.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
