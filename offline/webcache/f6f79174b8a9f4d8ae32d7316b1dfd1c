<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Every branch in me that beareth 
not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it,   
that it may bring forth more fruit.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3> 
<H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken     
unto you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>     
Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it 
abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>I am the vine, ye are the branches: 
He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for    
without me ye can do nothing.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>

is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are     
burned.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>If ye  
abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall 
be done unto you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD>
<P>Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my    
disciples.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>As

commandments, and abide in his love.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

love one another, as I have loved you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Henceforth I    
call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I   
have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have   
made known unto you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you,     
that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain:     
that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.</P>

before it hated you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because  
ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the  
world hateth you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than  
his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they     
have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>But all these things will they do unto you   
for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>If I had not come and spoken  
unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin.</P>

did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my 
Father.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>But  
this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their

you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the        
Father, he shall testify of me:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>
