the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity  
builded the temple unto YHVH ELOHIYM of Israel;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief 
of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your     
ELOHIYM, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esarhaddon    
king of Assur, which brought us up hither.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us   
to build an house unto our ELOHIYM; but we ourselves together will build unto   
YHVH ELOHIYM of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the people   
of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in     
building,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of     
Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And in the reign of    
Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they unto him an accusation     
against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam,   
Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of   
Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue, and     
interpreted in the Syrian tongue.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8>   
<H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a      
letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Then wrote Rehum the            
chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the      
Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites,  
the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, and the Elamites,</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And the rest of the       
nations whom the great and noble Asnapper brought over, and set in the cities

time.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>This   
is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto Artaxerxes the     
king; Thy servants the men on this side the river, and at such a time.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Be it known unto the 
king, that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem,      
building the rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof,    
and joined the foundations.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>    
13</H4></TD><TD><P>Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be         
builded, and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and  
custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Now because we have           
maintenance from the king's palace, and it was not meet for us to see the       
king's dishonour, therefore have we sent and certified the king;</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>That search may be made   
in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of    
the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto     
kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old   
time: for which cause was this city destroyed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>We certify the king that, if this city be    
builded again, and the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no   
portion on this side the river.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>
17</H4></TD><TD><P>Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and  
to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in       
Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>The letter which ye  
sent unto us hath been plainly read before me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And I commanded, and search hath been made,  
and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against       
kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>There have been mighty kings  
also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all countries beyond the river; and  
toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Give ye now commandment to cause these men   
to cease, and that this city be not builded, until another commandment shall be 
given from me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the     
hurt of the kings?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and  
Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem   
unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Then ceased the work of the house 
of ELAHH which is at Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign  
of Darius king of Persia.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright
