<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>And the inhabitants of          
Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of men  
that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah    
the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began 
to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was      
Athaliah the daughter of Omri.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>  
3</H4></TD><TD><P>He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his      
mother was his counselor to do wickedly.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore he did evil in the sight of YHVH like   
the house of Ahab: for they were his counselors after the death of his father   
to his destruction.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of     
Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramothgilead: and    
the Syrians smote Joram.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which 
were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah  
the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at    
Jezreel, because he was sick.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>   
7</H4></TD><TD><P>And the destruction of Ahaziah was of ELOHIYM by coming to    
Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of   
Nimshi, whom YHVH had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, that, when 
Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of    
Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he  
slew them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and        
brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because,     
said they, he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought YHVH with all his heart. So 
the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>But when Athaliah the mother  
of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed      
royal of the house of Judah.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>

son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, and   
put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king    
Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,)  
hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD
