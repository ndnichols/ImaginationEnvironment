<p>1. THE Bull hath yielded for the Bull the milk of heaven: the Son of Aditi can never be deceived.<br> According to his wisdom Varu&#7751;a knoweth all: may he, the Holy, hallow times for sacrifice.<br> 2 Gandharvi spake: may she, the Lady of the flood, amid the river's roaring leave my heart untouched.<br> May Aditi accomplish all that we desire, and may our eldest Brother tell us this as Chief.<br> 3 Yea, even this blessed Morning, rich in store of food, splendid, with heavenly lustre, hath shone out for man,<br> Since they, as was the wish of yearning Gods, brought forth that yearning Agni for the assembly as the Priest.<br> 4 And the fleet Falcon brought for sacrifice from afar this flowing Drop most excellent and keen of sight,<br> Then when the &#256;ryan tribes chose as Invoking Priest Agni the Wonder-Worker, and the hymn rose up.<br> 5 Still art thou kind to him who feeds thee as with grass, and, skilled in sacrifice, offers thee holy gifts.<br> When thou, having received the sage's strengthening food with lauds, after long toil, cornest with many more.<br> 6 Urge thou thy Parents, as a lover ' to delight: the Lovely One desires and craves it from his heart.<br> The priest calls out, the sacrificer shows his skill, the Asura tries his strength, and with the hymn is stirred.<br> 7 Far-famed is he, the mortal man, O Agni, thou Son of Strength, who hath obtained thy favour.<br> He, gathering power, borne onward by his horses, makes his days lovely in his might and splendour.<br> 8 When, Holy Agni, the divine assembly, the sacred synod mid the Gods, is gathered,<br> And when thou, Godlike One, dealest forth treasures, vouchsafe us, too, our portion of the riches.<br> 9 Hear us, O Agni, in your common dwelling: harness thy rapid car of Am&#7771;ta.<br> Bring Heaven and Earth, the Deities' Parents, hither: stay with us here, nor from the Gods be distant.</p>
