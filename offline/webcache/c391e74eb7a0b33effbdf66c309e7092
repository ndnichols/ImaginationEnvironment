<p>1 WITH words sent forth in holy hymns, Agni we supplicate, the Lord<br> Of many families who duly serve the Gods, yea, him whom others also praise.<br> 2 Men have won Agni, him who makes their strength abound: we, with oblations, worship thee.<br> Our gracious-minded Helper in our deeds of might, be thou, O Excellent, this day.<br> 3 Thee for our messenger we choose, thee, the Omniscient, for our Priest.<br> The flames of thee the mighty are spread wide around: thy splendour reaches to the sky.<br> 4 The Gods enkindle thee their ancient messenger,&#151;Varu&#7751;a, Mitra, Aryaman.<br> That mortal man, O Agni, gains through thee all wealth, who hath poured offerings unto thee.<br> 5 Thou, Agni, art a cheering Priest, Lord of the House, men's messenger:<br> All constant high decrees established by the Gods, gathered together, meet in thee.<br> 6 In thee, the auspicious One, O Agni, youthfullest, each sacred gift is offered up:<br> This day, and after, gracious, worship thou our Gods, that we may have heroic sons.<br> 7 To him in his own splendour bright draw near in worship the devout.<br> Men kindle Agni with their sacrificial gifts, victorious o&#146;er the enemies.<br> 8 V&#7771;tra they smote and slew, and made the earth and heaven and firmament a wide abode.<br> The glorious Bull, invoked, hath stood at Ka&#7751;va's side: loud neighed the Steed in frays for kine.<br> 9 Seat thee, for thou art mighty; shine, best entertainer of the Gods.<br> Worthy of sacred food, praised Agni! loose the smoke, ruddy and beautiful to see.<br> 10 Bearer of offerings, whom, best sacrificing Priest, the Gods for Manu's sake ordained;<br> Whom Ka&#7751;va, whom Medhy&#257;tithi made the source of wealth, and V&#7771;&#7779;an and Upastuta.<br> 11 Him, Agni, whom Medhy&#257;tithi, whom Ka&#7751;va kindled for his rite,<br> Him these our songs of praise, him, Agni, we extol: his powers shine out preeminent.<br> 12 Make our wealth perfect thou, O Agni, Lord divine: for thou hast kinship with the Gods.<br> Thou rulest as a King o&#146;er widely-famous strength: be good to us, for thou art great.<br> 13 Stand up erect to lend us aid, stand up like Savitar the God:<br> Erect as strength-bestower we call aloud, with unguents and with priests, on thee.<br> 14 Erect, preserve us from sore trouble; with thy flame burn thou each ravening demon dead.<br> Raise thou us up that we may walk and live: so thou shalt find our worship mid the Gods.<br> 15 Preserve us, Agni, from the fiend, preserve us from malicious wrong.<br> Save us from him who fain would injure us or slay, Most Youthful, thou with lofty light.<br> 16 Smite down as with a club, thou who hast fire for teeth, smite thou the wicked, right and left.<br> Let not the man who plots against us in the night, nor any foe prevail o&#146;er us.<br> 17 Agni hath given heroic might to Ka&#7751;va, and felicity:<br> Agni hath helped our friends, hath helped Medhy&#257;tithi, hath helped Upastuta to win.<br> 18 We call on Ugradeva, Yadu, Turva&#347;a, by means of Agni, from afar;<br> Agni, bring Navav&#257;stva and B&#7771;hadratha, Turv&#299;ti, to subdue the foe.<br> 19 Manu hath stablished thee a light, Agni, for all the race of men:<br> Sprung from the Law, oil-fed, for Ka&#7751;va hast thou blazed, thou whom the people reverence.<br> 20 The flames of Agni full of splendour and of might are fearful, not to be approached.<br> Consume for ever all demons and sorcerers, consume thou each devouring fiend.</p>
