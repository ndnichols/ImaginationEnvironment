<TD><P>Paul, a servant of ELOHIYM, and an apostle of YAHSHUA MASHIYACH,         
according to the faith of EL's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which  
is after godliness;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>In hope of eternal life, which ELOHIYM, that cannot lie, promised before 
the world began;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is        
committed unto me according to the commandment of ELOHIYM our Saviour;</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>To Titus, mine own son 
after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from ELOHIYM the Father and

NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou    
shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every  
city, as I had appointed thee:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>

children not accused of riot or unruly.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of 
ELOHIYM; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not     
given to filthy lucre;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy,

Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by   
sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>For there are many unruly and 
vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Whose mouths must be      
stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for    
filthy lucre's sake.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians  
are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them     
sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and        
commandments of men, that turn from the truth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto  
them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and  
conscience is defiled.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>They profess that they know EL; but in works they deny him, being   
abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</P></TD></TR>
