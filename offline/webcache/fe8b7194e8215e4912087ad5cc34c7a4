Chapter 18</H1></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to   
pray, and not to faint;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not ELOHIYM,      
neither regarded man:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying,       
Avenge me of mine adversary.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>    
4</H4></TD><TD><P>And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within    
himself, Though I fear not ELOHIYM, nor regard man;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Yet because this widow troubleth    
me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And the ADONAY said, Hear   
what the unjust judge saith.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>    
7</H4></TD><TD><P>And shall not ELOHIYM avenge his own elect, which cry day and 
night unto him, though he bear long with them?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>I tell you that he will avenge them speedily.  
Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And he spake this 
parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and  
despised others:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the     
other a publican.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, ELOHIYM, I thank thee,  
that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as    
this publican.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And the publican,         
standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote 
upon his breast, saying, ELOHIYM be merciful to me a sinner.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>I tell you, this man went     
down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth  
himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And they brought     
unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, 
they rebuked them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>But YAHSHUA called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to    
come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of EL.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Verily I say unto    
you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of EL as a little child shall in   
no wise enter therein.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do 
to inherit eternal life?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good,  
save one, that is, ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>    
20</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do    
not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy    
mother.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Now when YAHSHUA heard these      
things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast,  
and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, 
follow me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And when YAHSHUA saw 
that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches     
enter into the kingdom of EL!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>  
25</H4></TD><TD><P>For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye,   
than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of EL.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And they that heard it said, Who  
then can be saved?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with  
ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, Verily I   
say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or 
wife, or children, for the kingdom of EL's sake,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>Who shall not receive manifold    
more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>Then he took unto    
him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all      
things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be      
accomplished.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and        
spitefully entreated, and spitted on:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And they shall scourge him, and put him to      
death: and the third day he shall rise again.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>And they understood none of these things:    
and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were      
spoken.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat 
by the way side begging:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And they told him,   
that YAHSHUA of Nazareth passeth by.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>And he cried, saying, YAHSHUA, thou son of      
David, have mercy on me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his     
peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA     
stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he  
asked him,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, ADONAY, that I   
may receive my sight.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved  
thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying ELOHIYM: and    
all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto EL.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
