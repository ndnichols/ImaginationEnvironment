<p>1. THESE the most constant singer's invocations call thee who art to be invoked, O Hero;<br> Hymns call anew the chariot-borne, Eternal: by eloquence men gain abundant riches.<br> 2 I praise that Indra, known to all men, honoured with songs, extolled with hymns at sacrifices,<br> Whose majesty, rich in wondrous arts, surpasseth the magnitude of earth, and heaven in greatness.<br> 3 He hath made pathways, with the Sun to aid him, throughout the darkness that extended pathless.<br> Mortals who yearn to worship ne&#146;er dishonour, O Mighty God, thy Law who art Immortal.<br> 4 And he who did these things, where is that Indra? among what tribes? what people doth he visit?<br> What sacrifice contents thy mind , and wishes? What priest among them all? what hymn, O Indra?<br> 5 Yea, here were they who, born of old, have served thee, thy friends of ancient time, thou active Worker.<br> Bethink thee now of these, Invoked of many! the midmost and the recent, and the youngest.<br> 6 Inquiring after him, thy later servants, Indra, have gained thy former old traditions.<br> Hero, to whom the prayer is brought, we praise thee as great for that wherein we know thee mighty.<br> 7 The demon's strength is gathered fast against thee: great as that strength hath grown, go forth to meet it.<br> With thine own ancient friend and companion, the thunderbolt, brave Champion! drive it backward.<br> 8 Hear, too, the prayer of this thy present beadsman, O Indra, Hero, cherishing the singer.<br> For thou wast aye our fathers' Friend aforetime, still swift to listen to their supplication.<br> 9 Bring to our help this day, for our protection, Varu&#7751;a, Mitra , Indra, and the Maruts,<br> P&#363;&#7779;an and Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, Agni and Purandhi, Savitar also, and the Plants and Mountains.<br> 10 The singers here exalt with hymns and praises thee who art very Mighty and Most Holy.<br> Hear, when invoked, the invoker's invocation. Beside thee there is nonelike thee, Immortal!<br> 11 Now to my words come quickly thou who knowest, O Son of Strength, with all who claim our worship,<br> Who visit sacred rites, whose tongue is Agni, Gods who made Manu stronger than the Dasyu.<br> 12 On good and evil ways be thou our Leader, thou who art known to all as Path-preparer.<br> Bring power to us, O Indra, with thy Horses, Steeds that are best to draw, broad-backed, unwearied.</p>
