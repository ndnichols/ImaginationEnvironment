<TD><P>The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a     
witness of the sufferings of MASHIYACH, and also a partaker of the glory that   
shall be revealed:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Feed the flock of ELOHIYM which is among you, taking the oversight       
thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready 
mind;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Neither  
as being lords over ELOHIYM's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the      
chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not  
away.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>         
Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be      
subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for YHVH resisteth the    
proud, and giveth grace to the humble.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

of YHVH, that he may exalt you in due time:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for 
you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Be sober, 
be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh       
about, seeking whom he may devour:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9>  
<H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same  
afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>But the ELOHIYM of   
all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by MASHIYACH YAHSHUA,      
after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen,    
settle you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P> 
To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that  
this is the true grace of ELOHIYM wherein ye stand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD
