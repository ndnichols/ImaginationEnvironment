Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not      
seen.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>For by   
it the elders obtained a good report.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Through faith we understand that the worlds were  
framed by the word of ELOHIYM, so that things which are seen were not made of   
things which do appear.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>By faith Abel offered unto ELOHIYM a more excellent sacrifice than  
Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, EL testifying of his  
gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>By faith Enoch was translated that he should not  
see death; and was not found, because ELOHIYM had translated him: for before    
his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased EL.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>But without faith it is impossible  
to please him: for he that cometh to ELOHIYM must believe that he is, and that  
he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>By faith Noah, being warned of      
things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his   
house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the              
righteousness which is by faith.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>
8</H4></TD><TD><P>By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place   
which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not  
knowing whither he went.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange       
country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of    
the same promise:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker 
is ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was     
delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who 
had promised.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the  
stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore        
innumerable.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>
These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them 
afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that     
they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>For they that say such things declare        
plainly that they seek a country.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15>  
<H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from 
whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>But now they desire  
a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore ELOHIYM is not ashamed to be  
called their EL: for he hath prepared for them a city.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>By faith Abraham, when he was     
tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his   
only begotten son,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Accounting that      
ELOHIYM was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he       
received him in a figure.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>      
20</H4></TD><TD><P>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to   
come.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>By     
faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and          
worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention  
of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his 
bones.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>By    
faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because     
they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's          
commandment.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>
By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of      
Pharaoh's daughter;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of ELOHIYM, than to 
enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>Esteeming the reproach of MASHIYACH greater     
riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of   
the reward.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P> 
By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured,   
as seeing him who is invisible.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>
28</H4></TD><TD><P>Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of    
blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>By faith they passed through  
the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>By faith the    
walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>By faith the harlot  
Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies 
with peace.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of 
Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the    
prophets:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises,   
stopped the mouths of lions.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>   
34</H4></TD><TD><P>Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the       
sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to      
flight the armies of the aliens.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35>   
<H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>Women received their dead raised to life again: and      
others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a       
better resurrection:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea,         
moreover of bonds and imprisonment:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37>
<H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted,  
were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins;     
being destitute, afflicted, tormented;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they        
wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>And these all,  
having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>ELOHIYM having       
provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made      
perfect.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M.
