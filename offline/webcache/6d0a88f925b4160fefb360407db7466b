<p>1. MAN'S worship of the Gods hath three great lustres, and three celestial lights have they established<br> The Maruts gifted with pure strength adore thee, for thou, O Indra, art their sapient &#7770;&#7779;i.<br> 2 What time the Maruts sang their song to Indra, joyous when he had drunk of Soma juices,<br> He grasped his thunderbolt to slay the Dragon, and loosed, that they might flow, the youthful Waters.<br> 3 And, O ye Brahmans, Maruts, so may Indra drink draughts of this my carefully pressed Soma;<br> For this oblation found for man the cattle, and Indra, having quaffed it, slew the Dragon.<br> 4 Then heaven and earth he sundered and supported: wrapped even in these he struck the Beast with terror.<br> So Indra forced the Engulfer to disgorgement, and slew the D&#257;nava. panting against him.<br> 5 Thus all the Gods, O Maghavan, delivered to thee of their free will the draught of Soma;<br> When thou for Eta&#347;a didst cause to tarry the flying mares of S&#363;rya racing forward.<br> 6 When Maghavan with the thunderbolt demolished his nine-and-ninety castles all together,<br> The Maruts, where they met, glorified Indra: ye with the T&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;up hymn obstructed heaven.<br> 7 As friend to aid a friend, Agni dressed quickly three hundred buffaloes, even as he willed it.<br> And Indra, from man's gift, for V&#7771;tra's slaughter, drank ofr at once three lakes of pressed-out Soma.<br> 8 When thou three hundred buffaloes' flesh hadst eaten, and drunk, as Maghavan, three lakes of Soma,<br> All the Gods raised as &#146;twere a shout of triumph to Indra praise because he slew the Dragon.<br> 9 What time ye came with strong steeds swiftly speeding, O U&#347;an&#257; and Indra, to the dwelling,<br> Thou camest thither -conquering together with Kutsa and the Gods: thou slewest &#346;u&#7779;&#7751;a.<br> 10 One car-wheel of the Sun thou rolledst forward, and one thou settest free to move for Kutsa.<br> Thou slewest noseless Dasyus with thy weapon, and in their home o&#146;erthrewest hostile speakers.<br> 11 The lauds of Gauriviti made thee mighty to Vidathin's son, as prey, thou gavest Pipru.<br> Rjisivan drew thee into friendship dressing the sacred food, and thou hast drunk his Soma.<br> 12 Navagvas and Dasgvas with libations of Soma juice sing hymns of praise to Indra.<br> Labouring at their task the men laid open the stall of Kine though firmly closed and fastened.<br> 13 How shall I serve thee, Maghavan, though knowing full well what hero deeds thou hast accomplished?<br> And the fresh deeds which thou wilt do, Most Mighty! these, too, will we tell forth in sacred synods.<br> 14 Resistless from of old through hero courage, thou hast done all these many acts, O Indra.<br> What thou wilt do in bravery, Thunder-wielder! none is there who may hinder this thy prowess.<br> 15 Indra, accept the prayers which now are offered, accept the new prayers, Mightiest! which we utter.<br> Like fair and well-made robes, I, seeking riches, as a deft craftsman makes a car, have wrought them.</p>
