<p>1. Auspicious is the aspect of Vadhryasva's fire good is its guidance, pleasant are its visitings.<br> When first the people Of Sumitra kindle it, with butter poured thercon it crackles and shines bright.<br> 2 Butter is that which makes Vadhryaiva's fire growstrong: the butter is its food, the butter makes it fat.<br> It spreads abroad when butter hath been offered it, and balmed with streams of butter shines forth like the Sun.<br> 3 Still newest is this face of thine, O Agni, which Manu and Sumitra have enkindled.<br> So richly shine, accept our songs with favour, so give us strengthening food, so send us glory.<br> 4 Accept this offering, Agni, whom aforetime Vadhryasva, hath entreated and enkindled.<br> Guard well our homes and ople, guard our bodies, protect thy girt to us which thou hast granted.<br> 5 Be splendid, guard us Kinsman of Vadhryasva: let not the enmity of men o&#146;ercome thee,<br> Like the bold hero Cyav&#257;na, I Sumitra tell forth the title of Vadhryaiva's Kinsman.<br> 6 All treasures hast thou won, of plains and mountains, and quelled the D&#257;sas' and &#256;ryas' hatred.<br> Like the bold hero Cyav&#257;na, O Agni, mayst thou subdue the men who long for battle.<br> 7 Deft Agni hath a lengthened thread, tall oxen, a thousand heifers, numberless devices.<br> Decked by the men, splendid among the splendid, shine brightly forth amid devout Sumitras.<br> 8 Thine is the teeming cow, O J&#257;tavedas, who pours at once her ceaseless flow, Sabardhuk,<br> Thou. art lit up by men enriched with guerdon, O Agni, by the pious-souled Sumitras.<br> 9 Even Immortal Gods, O J&#257;tavedas, Vadhryasva's Kinsman, have declared thy grandeur.<br> When human tribes drew near with supplication thou conqueredst with men whom thou hadst strengthened.<br> 10 Like as a father bears his son, O Agni, Vadhryasva bare thee in his lap and served thee.<br> Thou, Youngest God, having enjoyed his fuel, didst vanquish those of old though they were mighty.<br> 11 Vadhryasva's Agni evermore hath vanquished his foes with heroes who had pressed the Soma.<br> Lord of bright rays, thou burntest up the battle, subduing, as our help, e&#146;en mighty foemen.<br> 12 This Agni of Vadhryasva, V&#7771;tra-slayer, lit from of old, must be invoked with homage.<br> As such assail our enemies, Vadhryasva, whether the foes be strangers or be kinsmen.</p>
