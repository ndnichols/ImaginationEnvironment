Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent YAHSHUA two disciples,</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Saying unto them, Go   
into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied,

ye shall say, The ADONAY hath need of them; and straightway he will send        
them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>All this

saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Tell   
ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting   
upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

commanded them,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they   
set him thereon.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down 
branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And the multitudes that went        
before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed  
is he that cometh in the name of YHVH; Hosanna in the highest.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he was come into     
Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And the multitude said, This is   
YAHSHUA the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables  
of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And said unto them, It is     
written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a    
den of thieves.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the    
chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the         
children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they    
were sore displeased,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And YAHSHUA saith   
unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings     
thou hast perfected praise?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>    
17</H4></TD><TD><P>And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and 
he lodged there.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he saw a    
fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, 
and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And          
presently the fig tree withered away.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled,  
saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA answered and said unto them, Verily  
I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this      
which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be  
thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And all things, whatsoever ye 
shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he was come into the     
temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was  
teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave     
thee this authority?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one    
thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do 
these things.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they         
reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say     
unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the        
people; for all hold John as a prophet.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And they answered YAHSHUA, and said, We cannot  
tell. And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these    
things.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>But  
what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said,  
Son, go work to day in my vineyard.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29>
<H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he       
repented, and went.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said,  
I go, sir: and went not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto     
him, The first. YAHSHUA saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the        
publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of EL before you.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>For John came unto you in 
the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the    
harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that 
ye might believe him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which        
planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it,    
and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far            
country:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen,   
that they might receive the fruits of it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat  
one, and killed another, and stoned another.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>Again, he sent other servants more than the     
first: and they did unto them likewise.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>But last of all he sent unto them his son,      
saying, They will reverence my son.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38>
<H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among     
themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his    
inheritance.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>
And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>When the lord        
therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>They say unto   
him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard  
unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA saith   
unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders    
rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is YHVH's doing, and  
it is marvellous in our eyes?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>  
43</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of EL shall be taken   
from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>And whosoever shall fall  
on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind   
him to powder.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they        
perceived that he spake of them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46>   
<H4>46</H4></TD><TD><P>But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared    
the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
