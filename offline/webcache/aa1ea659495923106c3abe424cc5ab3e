<TD><P>Hear the word of YHVH, ye children of Israel: for YHVH hath a            
controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor    
mercy, nor knowledge of ELOHIYM in the land.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.</P>

the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the

destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will   
also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast          
forgotten the law of thy ELOHIYM, I will also forget thy children.</P></TD></TR>

that doth not understand shall fall.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A
