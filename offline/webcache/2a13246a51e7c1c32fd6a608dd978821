1</H4></TD><TD><P>Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful 
disputations.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P> 
For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth      
herbs.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Let not 
him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not   
judge him that eateth: for ELOHIYM hath received him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Who art thou that judgest another   
man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be       
holden up: for ELOHIYM is able to make him stand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>One man esteemeth one day above     
another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in 
his own mind.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P> 
He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto YHVH; and he that regardeth not    
the day, to YHVH he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to YHVH, for he  
giveth ELOHIYM thanks; and he that eateth not, to YHVH he eateth not, and       
giveth ELOHIYM thanks.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>For whether we    
live, we live unto YHVH; and whether we die, we die unto YHVH: whether we live  
therefore, or die, we are YHVH's.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9>   
<H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>For to this end MASHIYACH both died, and rose, and        
revived, that he might be ADONAY both of the dead and living.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>But why dost thou judge thy   
brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand     
before the judgment seat of MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>For it is written, As I live, saith the EL,     
every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to YHVH.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>So then every one of 
us shall give account of himself to YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Let us not therefore judge one another any      
more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to 
fall in his brother's way.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>     
14</H4></TD><TD><P>I know, and am persuaded by the ADONAY YAHSHUA, that there   
is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be         
unclean, to him it is unclean.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4> 
15</H4></TD><TD><P>But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest     
thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom MASHIYACH died.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Let not then    
your good be evil spoken of:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>   
17</H4></TD><TD><P>For the kingdom of EL is not meat and drink; but             
righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>For he that in these things       
serveth MASHIYACH is acceptable to ELOHIYM, and approved of men.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Let us therefore follow   
after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify       
another.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>For 
meat destroy not the work of ELOHIYM. All things indeed are pure; but it is     
evil for that man who eateth with offence.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink   
wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made   
weak.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Hast   
thou faith? have it to thyself before ELOHIYM. Happy is he that condemneth not  
himself in that thing which he alloweth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.</P></TD>
