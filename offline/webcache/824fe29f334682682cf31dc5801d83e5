1</H4></TD><TD><P>What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining 
to the flesh, hath found?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory;   
but not before ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed YHVH, and it was     
counted unto him for righteousness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4> 
<H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of     
grace, but of debt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the    
ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Even as David also describeth the   
blessedness of the man, unto whom ELOHIYM imputeth righteousness without        
works,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Saying, 
Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Blessed is the    
man to whom YHVH will not impute sin.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Cometh this blessedness then upon the             
circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was   
reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>How was it then reckoned? when he was in        
circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in                 
uncircumcision.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the 
faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all  
them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be  
imputed unto them also:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the           
circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father   
Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>For the promise, that he should be the heir  
of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through  
the righteousness of faith.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>    
14</H4></TD><TD><P>For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made     
void, and the promise made of none effect:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law 
is, there is no transgression.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4> 
16</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the  
end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the 
law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us 
all,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>(As it  
is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he      
believed, even ELOHIYM, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which 
be not as though they were.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>    
18</H4></TD><TD><P>Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the  
father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed   
be.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And      
being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was   
about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb:</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>He staggered not at  
the promise of ELOHIYM through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory  
to EL;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to           
perform.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Now it was not written for his    
sake alone, that it was imputed to him;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed,   
if we believe on him that raised up YAHSHUA our ADONAY from the dead;</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Who was delivered    
for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.</P></TD></TR>
