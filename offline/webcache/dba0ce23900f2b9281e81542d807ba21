<p>1. AGNI, show favour: great art thou who to this pious man art come,<br> To seat thee on the sacred grass.<br> 2 May he the Immortal, Helper, bard to be deceived among mankind,<br> Become the messenger of all.<br> 3 Around the altar is he led, welcome Chief Priest at solemn rites,<br> Or as the Potar sits him down.<br> 4 Agni in fire at sacrifice, and in the house as Lord thereof,<br> And as a Brahman takes his seat.<br> 5 Thou comest as the guide of folk who celebrate a sacrifice,<br> And to oblations brought by men.<br> 6 Thou servest as his messenger whose sacrifice thou lovest well,<br> To bear the mortal's gifts to heaven.<br> 7 Accept our solemn rite; be pleased, A&#7749;giras, with our sacrifice:<br> Give ear and listen to our call.<br> 8 May thine inviolable car, wherewith thou guardest those who give,<br> Come near to us from every side.</p>
