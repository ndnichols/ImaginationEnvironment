<p>1. TASTE this strong draught enriched with offered viands: with all thy chariot here unyoke thy Coursers.<br> Let not those other sacrificers stay thee, Indra: these juices shed for thee are ready.<br> 2 Thine is the juice effused, thine are the juices yet to be pressed: our resonant songs invite thee.<br> O Indra, pleased to-day with this libation, come, thou who knowest all and drink the Soma.<br> 3 Whoso, devoted to the God, effuses Soma for him with yearning heart and spirit,&#151;<br> Never doth Indra give away his cattle: for him he makes the lovely Soma famous.<br> 4 He looks with Ioving favour on the mortal who, like a rich man, pours for him the Soma.<br> Maghavan in his bended arm supports him: he slays, unasked, the men who hate devotion.<br> 5 We call on thee to come to us, desirous of goods and spoil, of cattle, and of horses.<br> For thy new love and favour are we present: let us invoke thee, Indra, as our welfare.</p>
