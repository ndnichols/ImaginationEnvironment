<p>1. LOUD Singers, never humbled, active, full of strength, immovable, impetuous, manliest, best-beloved,<br> They have displayed themselves with glittering ornaments, a few in number only, like the heavens with stars.<br> 2 When, Maruts, on the steeps ye pile the moving cloud, ye are like birds on whatsoever path it be.<br> Clouds everywhere shed forth the rain upon your cars. Drop fatness, honey-hued, for him who sings your praise.<br> 3 Earth at their racings trembles as if weak and worn, when on their ways they yoke their cars for victory.<br> They, sportive, loudly roaring, armed with glittering spears, shakers of all, themselves admire their mightiness.<br> 4 Self-moving is that youthful band, with spotted steeds; thus it hath lordly sway, endued with power and might.<br> Truthful art thou, and blameless, searcher out of sin: so thou, Strong Host, wilt be protector of this prayer.<br> 5 We speak by our descent from our primeval Sire; our tongue, when we behold the Soma, stirs itself.<br> When, shouting, they had joined Indra in toil of fight, then only they obtained their sacrificial names.<br> 6 Splendours they gained for glory, they who wear bright rings; rays they obtained, and men to celebrate their praise.<br> Armed with their swords, impetuous and fearing naught, they have possessed the Maruts&#146; own beloved home.</p>
