Chapter 5</H1></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard  
that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a 
lover of David.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou knowest how that David my father could not   
build an house unto the name of YHVH his ELOHIYM for the wars which were about  
him on every side, until YHVH put them under the soles of his feet.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>But now YHVH my        
ELOHIYM hath given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary    
nor evil occurrent.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of YHVH my        
ELOHIYM, as YHVH spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set   
upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto my name.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Now therefore command thou  
that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy  
servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that 
thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can    
skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words   
of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be YHVH this day, which 
hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying,  
I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all    
thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>My servants shall      
bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in     
floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be     
discharged there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my     
desire, in giving food for my household.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees 
according to all his desire.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>   
11</H4></TD><TD><P>And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for 
food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to    
Hiram year by year.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And YHVH gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace    
between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And king Solomon raised a 
levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And he sent them to Lebanon,  
ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months   
at home: and Adoniram was over the levy.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand     
that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Beside the chief of       
Solomon's officers which were over the work, three thousand and three hundred,  
which ruled over the people that wrought in the work.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And the king commanded, and they  
brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of 
the house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the               
stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.</P></TD>
