<TD><P>In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king of      
Judah Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and       
reigned seventeen years.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And he did that which was evil in the sight of YHVH, and followed   
the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed    
not therefrom.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>
And the anger of YHVH was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into    
the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of      
Hazael, all their days.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And Jehoahaz besought YHVH, and YHVH hearkened unto him: for he saw 
the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>(And YHVH gave Israel  
a saviour, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians: and the    
children of Israel dwelt in their tents, as beforetime.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Nevertheless they departed not from 
the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked therein: and 
there remained the grove also in Samaria.)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz    
but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of 
Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Now the rest of the    
acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in   
the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And Jehoahaz slept with his         
fathers; and they buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his       
stead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>In    
the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the son of     
Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned sixteen years.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And he did that      
which was evil in the sight of YHVH; he departed not from all the sins of       
Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin: but he walked therein.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And the rest of the  
acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might wherewith he fought against   
Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of    
the kings of Israel?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne: 
and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Now Elisha was fallen sick of his 
sickness whereof he died. And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and  
wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel,    
and the horsemen thereof.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>      
15</H4></TD><TD><P>And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took   
unto him bow and arrows.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And he said to the king of Israel, Put thine hand upon the bow. And 
he put his hand upon it: and Elisha put his hands upon the king's hands.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said,    
Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he     
shot. And he said, The arrow of YHVH's deliverance, and the arrow of            
deliverance from Syria: for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou    
have consumed them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said unto the     
king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote thrice, and stayed.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And the man of       
ELOHIYM was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six   
times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it: whereas now   
thou shalt smite Syria but thrice.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20> 
<H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of   
the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, as they  
were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band of men; and they cast the   
man into the sepulchre of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and touched    
the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>But Hazael king of Syria          
oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH was gracious unto them, and had        
compassion on them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant with     
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them     
from his presence as yet.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>      
24</H4></TD><TD><P>So Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned   
in his stead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad the   
son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his    
father by war. Three times did Joash beat him, and recovered the cities of      
Israel.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M.
