</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>For yourselves,   
brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>But even after that we had  
suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we     
were bold in our EL to speak unto you the gospel of ELOHIYM with much           
contention.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>   
For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>But as we were    
allowed of ELOHIYM to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as 
pleasing men, but EL, which trieth our hearts.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>For neither at any time used we flattering     
words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; ELOHIYM is witness:</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Nor of men sought we   
glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome,   
as the apostles of MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>   
7</H4></TD><TD><P>But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her  
children:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>So   
being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto     
you, not the gospel of ELOHIYM only, but also our own souls, because ye were    
dear unto us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P> 
For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, 
because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the    
gospel of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Ye are witnesses, and ELOHIYM also, how holily and justly and            
unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>As ye know how we exhorted and    
comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children,</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>That ye would walk   
worthy of ELOHIYM, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>For this cause also thank 
we ELOHIYM without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of EL which ye   
heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the  
word of EL, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>For ye, brethren, became  
followers of the churches of ELOHIYM which in Judaea are in MASHIYACH YAHSHUA:  
for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have 
of the Jews:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>
Who both killed the ADONAY YAHSHUA, and their own prophets, and have persecuted 
us; and they please not ELOHIYM, and are contrary to all men:</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Forbidding us to speak to the 
Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath   
is come upon them to the uttermost.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17>
<H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time  
in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face     
with great desire.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but  
Satan hindered us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in  
the presence of our ADONAY YAHSHUA MASHIYACH at his coming?</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>For ye are our glory and      
joy.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M. Hurt,
