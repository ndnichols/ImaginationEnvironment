<p>1. THOU at thy birth art Varu&#7751;a, O Agni; when thou art kindled thou becomest Mitra.<br> In thee, O Son of Strength, all Gods are centred. Indra art thou to man who brings oblation.<br> 2 Aryaman art thou as regardeth maidens mysterious, is thy name, O Self-sustainer.<br> As a kind friend with streams of milk they balm thee what time thou makest wife and lord one-minded.<br> 3 The Maruts deck their beauty for thy glory, yea, Rudra! for thy birth fair, brightly-coloured.<br> That which was fixed as Vi&#7779;&#7751;u's loftiest station&#151;therewith the secret of the Cows thou guardest.<br> 4 Gods through thy glory, God who art so lovely! granting abundant gifts gained life immortal.<br> As their own Priest have men established Agni; and serve him fain for praise from him who liveth.<br> 5 There is no priest more skilled than thou in worship; none Self-sustainer pass thee in wisdom.<br> The man within whose house as guest thou dwellest, O God, by sacrifice shall conquer mortals.<br> 6 Aided by thee, O Agni may we conquer through our oblation, fain for wealth, awakened:<br> May we in battle, in the days&#146; assemblies, O Son of Strength, by riches conquer mortals.<br> 7 He shall bring evil on the evil-plotter whoever turns against us sin and outrage.<br> Destroy this calumny of him, O Agni, whoever injures us with double-dealing.<br> 8 At this dawn's flushing, God! our ancient fathers served thee with offerings, making thee their envoy,<br> When, Agni, to the store of wealth thou goest, a God enkindled with good things by mortals.<br> 9 Save, thou who knowest, draw thy father near thee, who counts as thine own son, O Child of Power.<br> O sapient Agni, when wilt thou regard us? When, skilled in holy Law, wilt thou direct us?<br> 10 Adoring thee he gives thee many a title, when thou, Good Lord! acceptest this as Father.<br> And doth not Agni, glad in strength of Godhead, gain splendid bliss when he hath waxen mighty?<br> 11 Most Youthful Agni, verily thou bearest thy praiser safely over all his troubles.<br> Thieves have been seen by us and open foemen: unknown have been the plottings of the wicked.<br> 12 To thee these eulogies have been directed: or to the Vasu hath this sin been spoken.<br> But this our Agni, flaming high, shall never yield us to calumny, to him who wrongs us.</p>
