<p>1. THROUGH the fine fingers, with the song, this Hero comes with rapid ears,<br> Going to Indra's special place.<br> 2 In holy thought he ponders much for the great worship of the Gods.<br> Where the Immortals have their seat.<br> 3 Like a good horse is he led out, when on the path that shines with light<br> The mettled steeds exert their strength.<br> 4 He brandishes his horns on high, and whets them Bull who leads the herd,<br> Doing with might heroic deeds.<br> 5 He moves, a vigorous Steed, adorned with beauteous rays of shining gold,<br> Becoming Sovran of the streams.<br> 6 He, over places rough to pass, bringing rich treasures closely packed.<br> Descends into the reservoirs.<br> 7 Men beautify him in the vats, him worthy to be beautified,<br> Him who brings forth abundant food.<br> 8 Him, even him, the fingers ten and the seven songs make beautiful,<br> Well-weaponed, best of gladdeners.</p>
