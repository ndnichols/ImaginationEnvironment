<p>1. FOR him the Mornings made their courses longer, and Nights with pleasant voices spake to Indra.<br> For him the Floods stood still, the Seven Mothers, Streams easy for the heroes to pass over.<br> 2 The Darter penetrated, though in trouble, thrice-seven close-pressed ridges of the mountains.<br> Neither might God nor mortal man accomplish what the Strong Hero wrought in full-grown vigour.<br> 3 The mightiest force is Indra's bolt of iron when firmly grasped in both the arms of Indra.<br> His head and mouth have powers that pass all others, and all his people hasten near to listen.<br> 4 1 count thee as the Holiest of the Holy, the caster-down of what hath ne&#146;er been shaken.<br> I count thee as the Banner of the heroes, I count thee as the Chief of all men living.<br> 5 What time, O Indra, in thine arms thou tookest thy wildly rushing bolt to Slay the Dragon,<br> The mountains roared, the cattle loudly bellowed, the Brahmans with their hymns drew nigh to Indra.<br> 6 Let us praise him who made these worlds and creatures, all things that after him sprang into being.<br> May we win Mitra with our songs, and Indra, and. wait upon our Lord with adoration.<br> 7 Flying in terror from the snort of V&#7771;tra, all Deities who were thy friends forsook thee.<br> So, Indra, be thy friendship with the Maruts: in all these battles thou shalt be the victor.<br> 8 Thrice-sixty Maruts, waxing strong, were with thee, like piles of beaming light, worthy of worship.<br> We come to thee: grant us a happy portion. Let us adore thy might with this oblation.<br> 9 A sharpened weapon is the host of Maruts. Who, Indra, dares withstand thy bolt of thunder?<br> Weaponless are the Asuras, the godless: scatter them with thy wheel, Impetuous Hero.<br> 10 To him the Strong and Mighty, most auspicious, send up the beAuteous hymn for sake of cattle.<br> Lay oa his body many songs for Indra invoked with song, for will not he regard. them?<br> 11 To him, the Mighty, who accepts laudation, send forth thy thought as by a boat o&#146;er rivers,<br> Stir with thy hymn the body of the Famous and Dearest One, for will not he regard it?<br> 12 Serve him with gifts of thine which Indra welcomes: praise with fair praise, invite him with thine homage.<br> Draw near, O singer, and refrain from outcry. Make thy voice heard, for will not he regard it?<br> 13 The Black Drop sank in Amsumati's bosom, advancing with ten thousand round about it.<br> Indra with might longed for it as it panted: the hero-hearted laid aside his weapons.<br> 14 1 saw the Drop in the far distance moving, on the slope bank of Amsumati's river,<br> Like a black cloud that sank into the water. Heroes, I send you forth. Go, fight in battle.<br> 15 And then the Drop in Amsumati's bosom, splendid with light, assumed its proper body;<br> And Indra, with B&#7771;haspati to aid him, conquered the godless tribes that came against him.<br> 16 Then, at thy birth, thou wast the foeman, Indra, of those the seven who ne&#146;er had met a rival.<br> The hidden Pair, the Heaven and Earth, thou foundest, and to the mighty worlds thou gavest pleasure.<br> 17 So, Thunder-armed! thou with thy bolt of thunder didst boldly smite that power which none might equal;<br> With weapons broughtest low the migbt of &#346;u&#7779;&#7751;a, and, Indra, foundest by thy strength the cattle.<br> 18 Then wast thou, Chieftain of all living mortals, the very mighty slayer of the V&#7771;tras.<br> Then didst thou set the obstructed rivers flowing, and win the floods that were enthralled by D&#257;sas.<br> 19 Most wise is he, rejoicing in libations, splendid as day, resistless in his anger.<br> He only doth great deeds, the only Hero, sole V&#7771;tra-slayer he, with none beside him.<br> 20 Indra is V&#7771;tra's slayer, man's sustainer: he must be called; with fair praise let us call him.<br> Maghavan is our Helper, our Protector, giver of spoil and wealth to make us famous.<br> 21 This Indra, V&#7771;tra-slayer, this &#7770;bhuk&#7779;an, even at his birth, was meet for invocation.<br> Doer of many deeds for man's advantage, like Soma quaffed, for friends we must invoke him.</p>
