<p>1. To fair goals travel Two unlike in semblance: each in succession nourishes an infant.<br> One bears a Godlike Babe of golden colour; bright and fair-shining, is he with the other.<br> 2 Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar's ten daughters, vigilant and youthful, produced this Infant borne to sundry quarters.<br> They bear around him whose long flames are pointed, fulgent among mankind with native splendour.<br> 3. Three several places of his birth they honour, in mid-air, in the heaven, and in the waters.<br> Governing in the east of earthly regions, the seasons hath he stablished in their order.<br> 4 Who of you knows this secret One? The Infant by his own nature hath brought forth his Mothers.<br> The germ of many, from the waters' bosom he goes forth, wise and great, of Godlike nature.<br> 5 Visible, fair, he grows in native brightness uplifted in the lap of waving waters.<br> When he was born both Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar's worlds were frightened: they turn to him and reverence the Lion.<br> 6 The Two auspicious Ones, like women, tend him: like lowing cows they seek him in their manner.<br> He is the Lord of Might among the mighty; him, on the right, they balm with their oblations.<br> 7 Like Savitar his arms with might he stretches; awful, he strives grasping the world's two borders.<br> He forces out from all a brilliant vesture, yea, from his Mothers draws he forth new raiment.<br> 8 He makes him a most noble form of splendour, decking him in his home with milk and waters.<br> The Sage adorns the depths of air with wisdom: this is the meeting where the Gods are worshipped.<br> 9 Wide through the firmament spreads forth triumphant the far-resplendent strength of thee the Mighty.<br> Kindled by us do thou preserve us, Agni, with all thy self-bright undiminished succours.<br> 10 In dry spots he makes stream, and course, and torrent, and inundates the earth with floods that glisten.<br> All ancient things within his maw he gathers, and moves among the new fresh-sprouting grasses.<br> 11 Fed with our fuel, purifying Agni, so blaze to us auspiciously for glory.<br> This prayer of ours may Varu&#7751;a grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu, Earth and Heaven.</p>
