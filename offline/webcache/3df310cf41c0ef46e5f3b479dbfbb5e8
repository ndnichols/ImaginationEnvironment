1</H4></TD><TD><P>So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are    
done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they    
had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they 
had no comforter.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD>
<P>Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living     
which are yet alive.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not  
seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Again, I considered all travail, and every     
right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity 
and vexation of spirit.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Better is an      
handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of   
spirit.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Then I 
returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>There is one alone, and there is not a second;    
yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour;  
neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I       
labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore     
travail.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Two   
are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>For if they fall,    
the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth;  
for he hath not another to help him up.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

heat: but how can one be warm alone?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Better is a poor and a wise child 
than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>For out of prison he cometh   
to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>I considered all the 
living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in   
his stead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>  
There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they 
also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and   
vexation of spirit.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by
