<p>1. INDRA, accept at break of day our Soma mixt with roasted corn,<br> With groats with cake, with eulogies.<br> 2 Accept, O Indra, and enjoy the well-dressed sacrificial cake: Oblations are poured forth to thee.<br> 3 Consume our sacrificial cake, accept the songs of praise we sing,<br> As he who woes accepts his bride.<br> 4 Famed from of old, accept the cake at our libation poured at dawn,<br> Forgreat, O Indra, is thy power.<br> 5 Let roasted corn of our midday libation, and sacrificial cake here please thee, Indra,<br> What time the lauding singer, keen of purpose and eager as a bull, with hymns implores thee.<br> 6 At the third sacrifice, O thou whom many praise, give glory to the roasted corn and holy cake.<br> With offered viands and with songs may we assist thee, Sage, whom V&#257;ja and the &#7770;bhus wait upon.<br> 7 The groats have we prepared for thee with P&#363;&#7779;an, corn for thee, Lord of Bay Steeds, with thy horses.<br> Eat thou the meal-cake, banded with the Maruts, wise Hero, V&#7771;tra-slayer, drink the Soma.<br> 8 Bring forth the roasted corn to meet him quickly, cake for the bravest Hero mid the heroes.<br> Indra, may hymns accordant with thee daily strengthen thee, Bold One, for the draught of Soma.</p>
