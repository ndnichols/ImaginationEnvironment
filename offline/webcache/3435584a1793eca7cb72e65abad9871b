<p>1. DULY enkindled after ancient customs, bringing all treasures, he is balmed with unguents,&#151;<br> Flame-haired, oil-clad, the purifying Agni, skilled in fair rites, to bring the Gods for worship.<br> 2 As thou, O Agni, skilful J&#257;tavedas, hast sacrificed as Priest of Earth, of Heaven,<br> So with this offering bring the Gods, and prosper this sacrifice today as erst for Manu.<br> 3 Three are thy times of life, O J&#257;tavedas, and the three mornings are thy births, O Agni.<br> With these, well-knowing, grant the Gods&#146; kind favour, and help in stir and stress the man who worships.<br> 4 Agni most bright and fair with song we honour, yea, the adorable, O J&#257;tavedas.<br> Thee, envoy, messenger, oblation-bearer, the Gods have made centre of life eternal.<br> 5 That Priest before thee, yet more skilled in worship, stablished of old, health-giver by his nature,&#151;<br> After his custom offer, thou who knowest, and lay our sacrifice where Gods may taste it.</p>
