<p>1. NOT men of magic skill, not men of wisdom impair the Gods&#146; first steadfast ordinances.<br> Ne&#146;er may the earth and heaven which know not malice, nor the fixed hills, be bowed by sage devices.<br> 2 One, moving not away, supports six burthens: the Cows proceed to him the true, the Highest.<br> Near stand three Mighty Ones who travel swiftly: two are concealed from sight, one is apparent.<br> 3 The Bull who wears all shapes, the triple-breasted, three-uddered, with a brood in many places,<br> Ruleth majestic with his triple aspect, the Bull, the Everlasting Ones' impregner.<br> 4 When nigh them, as their tracer he observed them: he called aloud the dear name of &#256;dityas.<br> The Goddesses, the Waters, stayed to meet him: they who were wandering separate enclosed him.<br> 5 Streams! the wise Gods have thrice three habitations. Child of three Mothers, he is Lord in synods.<br> Three are the holy Ladies of the Waters, thrice here from heaven supreme in our assembly.<br> 6 Do thou, O Savitar, from heaven thrice hither, three times a day, send down thy blessings daily.<br> Send us, O Bhaga, triple wealth and treasure; cause the two worlds to prosper us, Preserver!<br> 7 Savitar thrice from heaven pours down abundance, and the fair-handed Kings Varu&#7751;a, Mitra;<br> And spacious Heaven and Earth, yea, and the Waters, solicit wealth that Savitar may send us.<br> 8 Three are the bright realms, best, beyond attainment, and three, the Asura's Heroes, rule as Sovrans,<br> Holy and vigorous, never to be injured. Thrice may the Gods from heaven attend our synod.</p>
