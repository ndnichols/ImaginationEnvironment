I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might show     
these my signs before him:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's  
son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among  
them; that ye may know how that I am YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

said unto him, Thus saith YHVH ELOHIYM of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou       
refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve       
me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Else, if

<P>And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see   
the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which       
remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for    
you out of the field:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and  
the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers'    
fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day.   
And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH said unto Moses, Stretch

And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and YHVH brought an

them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>For they        
covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they

had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs  
of the field, through all the land of Egypt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Now     
therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat YHVH your

<P>And YHVH turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and

Egypt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>But   
YHVH hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel
