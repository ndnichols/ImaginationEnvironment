<p>1. WHEN Will men's guardians hasting hear with favour the song of A&#7749;giras's pious<br> <A HREF="errata.htm#3">children</A>?<br> When to the people of the home he cometh he strideth to the sacrifice, the Holy.<br> 2 He stablished heaven; he poured forth, skilful worker, the wealth of kine, for strength, that nurtures heroes.<br> The Mighty One his self-born host regarded, the horse's mate, the mother of the heifer.<br> 3 Lord of red dawns, he came victorious, daily to the A&#7749;girases' former invocation.<br> His bolt and team hath he prepared, and stablished the heaven for quadrupeds and men two-footed.<br> 4 In joy of this thou didst restore, for worship, the lowing company of hidden cattle.<br> When the three-pointed one descends with onslaught he opens wide the doors that cause man trouble.<br> 5 Thine is that milk which thy swift-moving Parents brought down, a strengthening genial gift for conquest;<br> When the pure treasure unto thee they offered, the milk shed from the cow who streameth nectar.<br> 6 There is he born. May the Swift give us rapture, and like the Sun shine forth from yonder dawning,<br> Indu, even us who drank, whose toils are offerings, poured from the spoon, with praise, upon the altar.<br> 7 When the wood-pile, made of good logs, is ready, at the Sun's worship to bind fast the Bullock,<br> Then when thou shinest forth through days of action for the Car-borne, the Swift, the Cattle-seeker.<br> 8 Eight steeds thou broughtest down from mighty heaven, when fighting for the well that giveth splendour,<br> That men might press with stones the gladdening yellow, strengthened with milk, fermenting, to exalt thee.<br> 9 Thou hurledst forth from heaven the iron missile, brought by the Skilful, from the sling of leather,<br> When thou, O Much-invoked, assisting Kutsa with endless deadly darts didst compass &#346;u&#7779;&#7751;a.<br> 10 Bolt-armed, ere darkness overtook the sunlight, thou castest at the veiling cloud thy weapon,<br> Thou rentest, out of heaven, though firmly knotted, the might of &#346;u&#7779;&#7751;a that was thrown around him.<br> 11 The mighty Heaven and Earth, those bright expanses that have no wheels, joyed, Indra, at thine exploit.<br> V&#7771;tra, the boar who lay amid the waters, to sleep thou sentest with thy mighty thunder.<br> 12 Mount Indra, lover of the men thou guardest, the well-yoked horses of the wind, best bearers.<br> The bolt which K&#257;vya U&#347;an&#257; erst gave thee, strong, gladdening, V&#7771;tra-slaying, hath he fashioned.<br> 13 The strong Bay Horses of the Sun thou stayedst: this Eta&#347;a drew not the wheel, O Indra.<br> Casting them forth beyond the ninety rivers thou dravest down into the pit the godless.<br> 14 Indra, preserve thou us from this affliction Thunder-armed, save us from the misery near us.<br> Vouchsafe us affluence in chariots, founded on horses, for our food and fame and gladness.<br> 15 Never may this thy loving-kindness fail us; mighty in strength, may plenteous food surround us.<br> Maghavan, make us share the foeman's cattle: may we be thy most liberal feast companions.</p>
