<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>In the beginning of the reign   
of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from YHVH,          
saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus   
saith YHVH; Stand in the court of YHVH's house, and speak unto all the cities   
of Judah, which come to worship in YHVH's house, all the words that I command   
thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>If so be they will hearken, and turn every man 
from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto 
them because of the evil of their doings.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith YHVH; If 
ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>To hearken to the 
words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early,  
and sending them, but ye have not hearkened;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will 
make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>So the priests and the prophets and 
all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of YHVH.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Now it came to    
pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that YHVH had commanded him 
to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the     
people took him, saying, Thou shalt surely die.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Why hast thou prophesied in the name of YHVH,  
saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate        
without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the 
house of YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the     
king's house unto the house of YHVH, and sat down in the entry of the new gate  
of YHVH's house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the  
people, saying, This man is worthy to die; for he hath prophesied against this  
city, as ye have heard with your ears.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to 
all the people, saying, YHVH sent me to prophesy against this house and against 
this city all the words that ye have heard.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore now amend your ways and your doings,  
and obey the voice of YHVH your ELOHIYM; and YHVH will repent him of the evil   
that he hath pronounced against you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>As for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with   
me as seemeth good and meet unto you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to   
death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this      
city, and upon the inhabitants thereof: for of a truth YHVH hath sent me unto   
you to speak all these words in your ears.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said the princes and all the people unto   
the priests and to the prophets; This man is not worthy to die: for he hath     
spoken to us in the name of YHVH our ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Then rose up certain of the elders of the    
land, and spake to all the assembly of the people, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Micah the Morasthite prophesied   
in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spake to all the people of Judah,    
saying, Thus saith YHVH of hosts; Zion shall be plowed like a field, and        
Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places  
of a forest.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>
Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he not    
fear YHVH, and besought YHVH, and YHVH repented him of the evil which he had    
pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And there was   
also a man that prophesied in the name of YHVH, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of   
Kirjathjearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according 
to all the words of Jeremiah.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>  
21</H4></TD><TD><P>And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and    
all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but when 
Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt;</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And Jehoiakim the king sent   
men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him    
into Egypt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim the  
king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of    
the common people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah,    
that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to         
death.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M.
