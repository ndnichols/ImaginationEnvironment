<p>1. O AGNI, with thy mighty wealth guard us from all malignity,<br> Yea, from all hate of mortal man.<br> 2 For over thee, O Friend from birth, the wrath of man hath no control:<br> Nay, Guardian of the earth art thou.<br> 3 As such, with all the Gods, O Son of Strength, auspicious in thy flame.<br> Give us wealth bringing all things good.<br> 4 Malignities stay not from wealth the mortal man whom, Agni, thou<br> Protectest while he offers gifts.<br> 5 Sage Agni, be whom thou dost urge, in worship of the Gods, to wealth,<br> With thine assistance winneth kine.<br> 6 Riches with many heroes thou hast for the man who offers gifts:<br> Lead thou us on to higher bliss.<br> 7 Save us, O J&#257;tavedas, nor abandon us to him who sins,<br> Unto the evil-hearted man.<br> 8 O Agni, let no godless man avert thy bounty as a God:<br> Over all treasures thou art Lord.<br> 9 So, Son of Strength, thou aidest us to what is great and excellent.<br> Those, Vasu! Friend! who sing thy praise.<br> 10 Let our songs come anear to him beauteous and bright with piercing flame<br> Our offerings, with our homage, to the<br> Lord of wealth, to him whom many praise, for help:<br> 11 To Agni J&#257;tavedas, to the Son of Strength, that he may give us precious gifts,<br> Immortal, from of old Priest among mortal men, the most delightful in the house.<br> 12 Agni, made yours by sacrifice, Agni, while holy rites advance;<br> Agni, the first in songs, first with the warrior steed; Agni to win the land for us.<br> 13 May Agni who is Lord of wealth vouchsafe us food for friendship sake.<br> Agni we ever seek for seed and progeny, the Vasu who protects our lives.<br> 14 Solicit with your chants, for help, Agni the God with piercing flame,<br> For riches famous Agni, Purum&#299;lha and ye men! Agni to light our dwelling well.<br> 15 Agni we laud that he may keep our foes afar, Agni to give us health and strength.<br> Let him as Guardian be invoked in all the tribes, the lighter-up of glowing brands.</p>
