Chapter 6</H1></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the     
children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of    
Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that  
he began to build the house of YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2>
<H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And the house which king Solomon built for YHVH, the      
length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits,    
and the height thereof thirty cubits.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And the porch before the temple of the house,     
twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house;    
and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And for the house he made windows   
of narrow lights.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the 
walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he    
made chambers round about:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4>
</TD><TD><P>The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was    
six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall 
of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be   
fastened in the walls of the house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7> 
<H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And the house, when it was in building, was built of      
stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither       
hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in         
building.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>The  
door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went   
up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the  
third.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>So he   
built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards   
of cedar.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they    
rested on the house with timber of cedar.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And the word of YHVH came to Solomon,           
saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>     
Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my       
statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in     
them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy       
father:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people       
Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>So   
Solomon built the house, and finished it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And he built the walls of the house within with 
boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: and 
he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house     
with planks of fir.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and 
the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, even for the  
oracle, even for the most holy place.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And the house, that is, the temple before it,   
was forty cubits long.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open    
flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And the oracle he prepared in the 
house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And the oracle in the         
forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty  
cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered 
the altar which was of cedar.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>  
21</H4></TD><TD><P>So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he  
made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it    
with gold.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: 
also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And within the oracle he  
made two cherubim of olive tree, each ten cubits high.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And five cubits was the one wing  
of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost 
part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And the other   
cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubim were of one measure and one size.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>The height of   
the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And he set the cherubim   
within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubim, so  
that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub 
touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the 
house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
he overlaid the cherubim with gold.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29>
<H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And he carved all the walls of the house round about     
with carved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, within and     
without.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
the floors of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And for the entering of   
the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth  
part of the wall.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings  
of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and   
spread gold upon the cherubim, and upon the palm trees.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>So also made he for the door of   
the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part of the wall.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>And the two doors were of fir     
tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the    
other door were folding.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And he carved thereon cherubim and palm trees and open flowers: and 
covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>And he built the inner court with 
three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>In the fourth year was the        
foundation of the house of YHVH laid, in the month Zif:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>And in the eleventh year, in the  
month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the 
parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in 
building it.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John
