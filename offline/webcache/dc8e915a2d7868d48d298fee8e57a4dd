<TD><P>My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And  
if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, YAHSHUA MASHIYACH the      
righteous:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's only, but also for the   
sins of the whole world.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his              
commandments.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P> 
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the 
truth is not in him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of ELOHIYM         
perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>He that saith he abideth in him ought himself  
also so to walk, even as he walked.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7> 
<H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old 
commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word    
which ye have heard from the beginning.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which  
thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true     
light now shineth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness 
even until now.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD>
<P>He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion  
of stumbling in him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in       
darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded  
his eyes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>I  
write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his     
name's sake.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>
I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the           
beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked     
one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>I have written  
unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have 
written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of ELOHIYM     
abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Love not the world, neither the   
things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father 
is not in him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the     
eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And the world        
passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of ELOHIYM       
abideth for ever.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that          
antiMASHIYACH shall come, even now are there many antiMASHIYACHs; whereby we    
know that it is the last time.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4> 
19</H4></TD><TD><P>They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they  
had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out,  
that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>But ye have an unction from   
the Holy One, and ye know all things.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>I have not written unto you because ye know not 
the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Who is a liar but he 
that denieth that YAHSHUA is the MASHIYACH? He is antiMASHIYACH, that denieth   
the Father and the Son.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that    
acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have  
heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall  
remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And this is the      
promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>These things have I written unto  
you concerning them that seduce you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>But the anointing which ye have received of him 
abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same         
anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as  
it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And now, little children, abide in him; that,   
when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at  
his coming.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P> 
If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth              
righteousness is born of him.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
