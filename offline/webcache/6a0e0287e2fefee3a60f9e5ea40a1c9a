that have knowledge.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD>

<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Let us choose to us judgment:   
let us know among ourselves what is good.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Which goeth in company with the     
workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

man nothing that he should delight himself with ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

ungodly?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>How 
much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the

iniquity may hide themselves.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>

Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>So that they    
cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the       
afflicted.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>  
When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his     
face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against  
a man only:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P> 
That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I:          
therefore speak what thou knowest.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34>

rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his
