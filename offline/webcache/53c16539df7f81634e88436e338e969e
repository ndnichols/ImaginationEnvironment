I may show him kindness for Jonathan's sake?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And there was of the house of Saul a servant      
whose name was Ziba. And when they had called him unto David, the king said     
unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of ELOHIYM unto him? And 
Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his feet.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And the king said 
unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house  
of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lodebar.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the

Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did    
reverence. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy            
servant!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely show thee kindness for         
Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy      
father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And he bowed himself, and said,     
What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the king     
called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy        
master's son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou therefore, and thy sons, 
and thy servants, shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in the      
fruits, that thy master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy        
master's son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and   
twenty servants.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king     
hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth, said  
the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons.</P></TD></TR><TR>

servants unto Mephibosheth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>
