<p>1. ROUSING the lands where men's Five Tribes are settled, Dawn hath disclosed the pathways of the people.<br> She hath sent out her sheen with beauteous oxen. The Sun with light hath opened earth and heaven.<br> 2 They paint their bright rays on the sky's far limits. the Dawns come on like tribes arrayed for battle.<br> Thy cattle, closely shutting up the darkness, as Savitar spreads his arms, give forth their lustre.<br> 3 Wealthy, most like to Indra, Dawn hath risen, and brought forth lauds that shall promote our welfare.<br> Daughter of Heaven, a Goddess, she distributes, best of A&#7749;girases, treasures to the pious.<br> 4 Bestow on us, O Dawn, that ample bounty which thou didst send to those who sang thy praises;<br> Thou whom with bellowings of a bull they quickened: thou didst unbar the firm-set mountain's portals.<br> 5 Impelling every God to grant his bounty sending to us the charm of pleasant voices,<br> Vouchsafe us thoughts, for profit, as thou breakest. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
