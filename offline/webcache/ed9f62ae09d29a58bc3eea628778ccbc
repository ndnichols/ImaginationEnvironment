merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away  
from the evil to come.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, each one  
walking in his uprightness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>

the adulterer and the whore.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>

wide mouth, and draw out the tongue? are ye not children of transgression, a    
seed of falsehood.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the      
children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Among the smooth stones of the      
stream is thy portion; they, they are thy lot: even to them hast thou poured a  
drink offering, thou hast offered a meat offering. Should I receive comfort in  
these?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Upon a  
lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even thither wentest thou up to  
offer sacrifice.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance: for    
thou hast discovered thyself to another than me, and art gone up; thou hast     
enlarged thy bed, and made thee a covenant with them; thou lovedst their bed    
where thou sawest it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase thy       
perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debase thyself even  
unto hell.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; yet saidst thou not, There is no

grieved.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast lied, and hast not      
remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of old,  
and thou fearest me not?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4>

profit thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>
When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind shall carry them 
all away; vanity shall take them: but he that putteth his trust in me shall     
possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And shall say, Cast ye up, cast   
ye up, prepare the way, take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my         
people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>For  
thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; 
I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and     
humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of   
the contrite ones.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD>

<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>For the iniquity of his       
covetousness was I wroth, and smote him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went
