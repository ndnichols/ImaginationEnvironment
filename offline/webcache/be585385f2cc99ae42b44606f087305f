Chapter 9</H1></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And as YAHSHUA passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his          
birth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And his 
disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents,     
that he was born blind?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents:    
but that the works of ELOHIYM should be made manifest in him.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>I must work the works of him    
that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>As long as I am in the 
world, I am the light of the world.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6> 
<H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made  
clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the         
clay,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And said 
unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.)   
He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>The neighbours therefore, and they  
which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and  
begged?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Some   
said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore said they  
unto him, How were thine eyes opened?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>He answered and said, A man that is called      
YAHSHUA made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of  
Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said they unto him,      
Where is he? He said, I know not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13>  
<H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was     
blind.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
it was the sabbath day when YAHSHUA made the clay, and opened his eyes.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Then again the       
Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He   
put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore said some of the        
Pharisees, This man is not of ELOHIYM, because he keepeth not the sabbath day.  
Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a   
division among them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he 
hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>But the Jews did not believe      
concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they      
called the parents of him that had received his sight.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And they asked them, saying, Is   
this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>His parents answered 
them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>But by what     
means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he   
is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>These words spake his parents, because they  
feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess   
that he was MASHIYACH, he should be put out of the synagogue.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore said his parents,   
He is of age; ask him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him,   
Give ELOHIYM the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>He answered and said, Whether 
he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind,  
now I see.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>He answered     
them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it  
again? will ye also be his disciples?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his   
disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>We know that ELOHIYM spake unto Moses: as for   
this fellow, we know not from whence he is.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>The man answered and said unto them, Why herein 
is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath      
opened mine eyes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Now we know that ELOHIYM heareth not sinners: but if any man be a        
worshipper of EL, and doeth his will, him he heareth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>Since the world began was it not  
heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>If this man were not of       
ELOHIYM, he could do nothing.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>  
34</H4></TD><TD><P>They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born   
in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA heard that they had cast  
him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the  
Son of ELOHIYM?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD>
<P>He answered and said, Who is he, ADOWN, that I might believe on him?</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA said     
unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, ADONAY, 
I believe. And he worshipped him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39>  
<H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA said, For judgment I am come into this       
world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made 
blind.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, 
Are we blind also?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>YAHSHUA said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now 
ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This
