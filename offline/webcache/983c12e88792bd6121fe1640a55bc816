Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him  
of the hands of the Ishmaelites, which had brought him down thither.</P></TD>

Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the  
Egyptian.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And

overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass from    
the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had,  
that YHVH blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of   
YHVH was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.</P></TD></TR><TR>

greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but   
thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and

a loud voice:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD>

her, until his lord came home.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>

was kindled.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>
And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the    
king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>But YHVH was with Joseph, and
