<p>1. GRACIOUSLY-MINDED he is flowing on his way to win dear names o&#146;er which the Youthful One grows great.<br> The Mighty and Far-seeing One hath mounted now the mighty S&#363;rya's car which moves to every side.<br> 2 The Speaker, unassailable Master of this hymn, the Tongue of sacrifice pours forth the pleasant meath.<br> Within the lustrous region of the heavens the Son makes the third secret name of Mother and of Sire.<br> 3 Sending forth flashes he hath bellowed to the jars, led by the men into the golden reservoir.<br> The milky streams of sacrifice have sung to him: he of the triple height shines brightly through the morns.<br> 4 Pressed by the stones, with hymns, and graciously inclined, illuminating both the Parents, Heaven and Earth,<br> He flows in ordered season onward through the flee, a current of sweet juice still swelling day by day.<br> 5 Flow onward, Soma, flow to bring prosperity: cleansed by the men, invest thee with the milky draught.<br> What gladdening drinks thou hast, foaming, exceeding strong, even with these incite Indra to give us wealth.</p>
