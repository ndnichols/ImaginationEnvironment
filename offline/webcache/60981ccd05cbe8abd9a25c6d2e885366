<p>1. HE in mid-air's expanse hath golden tresses; a raging serpent, like the rushing tempest:<br> Purely refulgent, knowing well the morning; like honourable dames, true, active workers.<br> 2 Thy well-winged flashes strengthen in their manner, when the black Bull hath bellowed round about us.<br> With drops that bless and seem to smile he cometh: the waters fall, the clouds utter their thunder.<br> 3 When he comes streaming with the milk of worship, conducting by directest paths of Order<br> Aryaman, Mitra, Varu&#7751;a, Parijman fill the hide full where lies the nether press-stone.<br> 4 O Agni, thou who art the lord of wealth in kine, thou Son of Strength,<br> Vouchsafe to us, O J&#257;tavedas, high renown.<br> 5 He, Agni, kindled, good and wise, must be exalted in our song:<br> Shine, thou of many forms, shine radiantly on us.<br> 6 O Agni, shining of thyself by night and when the morning breaks,<br> Burn, thou whose teeth are sharp, against the R&#257;k&#7779;asas.<br> 7 Adorable in all our rites, favour us, Agni, with thine aid,<br> When the great hymn is chanted forth.<br> 8 Bring to us ever-conquering wealth, wealth, Agni, worthy of our choice,<br> In all our frays invincible.<br> 9 Give us, O Agni, through thy grace wealth that supporteth all our life,<br> Thy favour so that we may live.<br> 10 O Gotama, desiring bliss present thy songs composed with care<br> To Agni of the pointed flames.<br> 11 May the man fall, O Agni, who near or afar assaileth us:<br> Do thou increase and prosper us.<br> 12 Keen and swift Agni, thousand-eyed, chaseth the R&#257;k&#7779;asas afar:<br> He singeth, herald meet for lauds.</p>
