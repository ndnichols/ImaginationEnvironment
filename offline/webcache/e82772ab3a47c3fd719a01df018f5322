<p>1. YOUR men have followed Indra for his friendship, and for his loving-kindness glorified him.<br> For he bestows great wealth, the Thunder-wielder: worship him, Great and Kind, to win his favour.<br> 2 Him to whose hand, men closely cling, and drivers stand on his golden chariot firmly stationed.<br> With his firm arms he holds the reins; his Horses, the Stallions, are yoked ready for the journey.<br> 3 Thy devotees embrace thy feet for glory. Bold, thunder-armed, rich, through thy strength, in guerdon,<br> Robed in a garment fair as heaven to look on, thou hast displayed thee like an active dancer.<br> 4 That Soma when effused hath best consistence, for which the food is dressed and grain is mingled;<br> By which the men who pray, extolling Indra chief favourites of Gods, recite their praises.<br> 5 No limit of thy might hath been appointed, which by its greatness sundered earth and heaven.<br> These the Prince filleth full with strong endeavour, driving, as &#146;twere, with help his flocks to waters.<br> 6 So be the lofty Indra prompt to listen, Helper unaided, golden-visored Hero.<br> Yea, so may he, shown forth in might unequalled, smite down the many V&#7771;tras and the Dasyus.</p>
