<TD><P>When therefore the ADONAY knew how the Pharisees had heard that YAHSHUA  
made and baptized more disciples than John,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>(Though YAHSHUA himself baptized not, but his     
disciples,)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>He 
left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And he must needs go through Samaria.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Then cometh he to a    
city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that      
Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>   
6</H4></TD><TD><P>Now Jacob's well was there. YAHSHUA therefore, being wearied  
with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>There cometh a    
woman of Samaria to draw water: YAHSHUA saith unto her, Give me to drink.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>(For his          
disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Then saith the woman of Samaria     
unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a      
woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA answered and 
said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of ELOHIYM, and who it is that saith to 
thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have      
given thee living water.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4>
</TD><TD><P>The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and  
the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Art thou greater than our 
father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his        
children, and his cattle?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>      
13</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of    
this water shall thirst again:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4> 
14</H4></TD><TD><P>But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him    
shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well  
of water springing up into everlasting life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this     
water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA saith unto her, Go, call  
thy husband, and come hither.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>  
17</H4></TD><TD><P>The woman answered and said, I have no husband. YAHSHUA said 
unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>For thou hast had five husbands;  
and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>The woman saith 
unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Our fathers worshipped in this    
mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to         
worship.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>    
YAHSHUA saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall       
neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye worship ye know   
not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>But the hour cometh, and  
now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in     
truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>ELOHIYM is a Spirit: and they     
that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>The woman saith unto him, I know  
that MASHIYACH cometh, which is called ANOINTED: when he is come, he will tell  
us all things.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>YAHSHUA saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And upon this came his disciples, 
and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest      
thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>The woman then left her waterpot, and went her  
way into the city, and saith to the men,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Come, see a man, which told me all things that  
ever I did: is not this the MASHIYACH?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>Then they went out of the city, and came unto   
him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>In the  
mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>But he said unto them, I have     
meat to eat that ye know not of.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33>   
<H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any    
man brought him ought to eat?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>  
34</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him    
that sent me, and to finish his work.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then 
cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the      
fields; for they are white already to harvest.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and     
gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth 
may rejoice together.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>I sent you to   
reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered 
into their labours.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying   
of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>So when the Samaritans were   
come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode    
there two days.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And many more believed because of his own word;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>And said unto the woman, Now we   
believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know   
that this is indeed the MASHIYACH, the Saviour of the world.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>Now after two days he         
departed thence, and went into Galilee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>For YAHSHUA himself testified, that a prophet   
hath no honour in his own country.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45> 
<H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P>Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans       
received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: 
for they also went unto the feast.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46> 
<H4>46</H4></TD><TD><P>So YAHSHUA came again into Cana of Galilee, where he     
made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at    
Capernaum.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>47</H4></TD><TD><P>  
When he heard that YAHSHUA was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto    
him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at  
the point of death.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V48><H4>48</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Then said YAHSHUA unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not 
believe.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V49><H4>49</H4></TD><TD><P>The 
nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V50><H4>50</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA saith unto him, Go thy    
way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that YAHSHUA had spoken unto 
him, and he went his way.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V51><H4>      
51</H4></TD><TD><P>And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told 
him, saying, Thy son liveth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V52><H4>   
52</H4></TD><TD><P>Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend.    
And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V53><H4>53</H4></TD><TD><P>So the father   
knew that it was at the same hour, in the which YAHSHUA said unto him, Thy son  
liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V54><H4>54</H4></TD><TD><P>This is again the second miracle  
that YAHSHUA did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.</P></TD></TR>
