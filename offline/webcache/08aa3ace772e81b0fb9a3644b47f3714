<TD><P>Now before the feast of the passover, when YAHSHUA knew that his hour    
was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved  
his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And supper being ended, the     
devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray   
him;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA   
knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was    
come from ELOHIYM, and went to EL;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4>  
<H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and   
took a towel, and girded himself.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5>   
<H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to    
wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was      
girded.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Then   
cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, ADONAY, dost thou wash my   
feet?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA  
answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know 
hereafter.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. YAHSHUA answered him, If I 
wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Simon Peter saith unto him, ADONAY, not my feet   
only, but also my hands and my head.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA saith to him, He that is washed needeth 
not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not   
all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>For he  
knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>So after he had      
washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said  
unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye call me Master and ADONAY: and ye say well;  
for so I am.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>
If I then, your ADONAY and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash 
one another's feet.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD>
<TD><P>For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to     
you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Verily, 
verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he    
that is sent greater than he that sent him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do  
them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>I      
speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be  
fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Now I tell you  
before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Verily, verily, 
I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that   
receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>When YAHSHUA had thus said, he was troubled in  
spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of    
you shall betray me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he       
spake.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Now   
there was leaning on YAHSHUA' bosom one of his disciples, whom YAHSHUA          
loved.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Simon 
Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he 
spake.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>He    
then lying on YAHSHUA' breast saith unto him, ADONAY, who is it?</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA answered, He it   
is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped   
the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And after the sop Satan entered   
into him. Then said YAHSHUA unto him, That thou doest, do quickly.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Now no man at the table   
knew for what intent he spake this unto him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>For some of them thought, because Judas had the 
bag, that YAHSHUA had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of      
against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>He then having received   
the sop went immediately out: and it was night.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore, when he was gone out, YAHSHUA     
said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and ELOHIYM is glorified in him.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>If ELOHIYM be        
glorified in him, EL shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway   
glorify him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>
Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I   
said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>A new commandment I  
give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love 
one another.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>
By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to     
another.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Simon Peter said unto him, ADONAY, whither goest thou? YAHSHUA answered him,    
Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me            
afterwards.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Peter said unto him, ADONAY, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my   
life for thy sake.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>YAHSHUA answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily,   
verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me      
thrice.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M.
