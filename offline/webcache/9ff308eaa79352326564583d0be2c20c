<p>1. BEDEWED with holy oil and meetly worshipped, the Swift One vies with S&#363;rya's beam in splendour.<br> For him may mornings dawn without cessation who saith, Let us press Soma out for Indra.<br> 2 With kindled fire and strewn grass let him worship, and, Soma-presser, sing with stones adjusted:<br> And let the priest whose press-stones ring forth loudly, go down with his oblation to the river.<br> 3 This wife is coming near who loves her husband who carries to his home a vigorous consort.<br> Here may his car seek fame, here loudly thunder, and his wheel make a thousand revolutions.<br> 4 No troubles vex that King in whose home Indra drinks the sharp Soma juice with milk commingled.<br> With heroes he drives near, he slays the foeman: Blest, cherishing that name, he guards his people.<br> 5 May he support in peace and win in battle: he masters both the hosts that meet together.<br> Dear shall he be to S&#363;rya, dear to Agni, who with pressed Soma offers gifts to India.</p>
