<TD><P>In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, 
YAHSHUA called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them,</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>I have compassion on the        
multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to   
eat:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And if I  
send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for     
divers of them came from far.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>   
4</H4></TD><TD><P>And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy 
these men with bread here in the wilderness?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And   
they said, Seven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven 
loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before     
them; and they did set them before the people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And they had a few small fishes: and he        
blessed, and commanded to set them also before them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>So they did eat, and were filled:   
and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And they that had eaten     
were about four thousand: and he sent them away.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And straightway he entered into a 
ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And the Pharisees came    
forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven,       
tempting him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek 
after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this     
generation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other        
side.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Now    
the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with    
them more than one loaf.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the 
Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It  
is because we have no bread.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>   
17</H4></TD><TD><P>And when YAHSHUA knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, 
because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your 
heart yet hardened?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not     
remember?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>   
When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of      
fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the seven among four     
thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said,         
Seven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And he cometh to Bethsaida; and   
they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And he took the blind man 
by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and 
put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And he looked up, and said, I see 
men as trees, walking.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look  
up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And he sent him away to his       
house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA     
went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the    
way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And they        
answered, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others, One of the         
prophets.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and      
saith unto him, Thou art the MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And he charged them that they should tell no    
man of him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be 
rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed,   
and after three days rise again.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32>   
<H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and 
began to rebuke him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he        
rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the    
things that be of ELOHIYM, but the things that be of men.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he had called the people 
unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after  
me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>For whosoever will save   
his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the   
gospel's, the same shall save it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36>  
<H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the     
whole world, and lose his own soul?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37>
<H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>Whosoever       
therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful  
generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the  
glory of his Father with the holy angels.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This
