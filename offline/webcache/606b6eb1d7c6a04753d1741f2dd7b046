<p>1. THIS, even this was my resolve, to win a cow, to win a steed:<br> Have I not drunk of Soma juice?<br> 2 Like violent gusts of wind the draughts that I have drunk have lifted me<br> Have I not drunk of Soma juice?<br> 3 The draughts I drank have borne me up, as fleet-foot horses draw a car:<br> Have I not drunk of Soma juice?<br> 4 The hymn hath reached me, like a cow who lows to meet her darling calf:<br> Have I not drunk of Soma juice?<br> 5 As a wright bends a chariot-seat so round my heart I bend the hymn:<br> Have I not drunk of Soma juice?<br> 6 Not as a mote within the eye count the Five Tribes of men with me:<br> Have I not drunk of Soma juice?<br> 7 The heavens and earth themselves have not grown equal to one half of me<br> Have I not drunk of Soma juice?<br> 8 I in my grandeur have surpassed the heavens and all this spacious earth<br> Have I not drunk of Soma juice?<br> 9 Aha! this spacious earth will I deposit either here or there<br> Have I not drunk of Soma juice?<br> 10 In one short moment will I smite the earth in fury here or there:<br> Have I not drunk of Soma juice?<br> 11 One of my flanks is in the sky; I let the other trail below:<br> Have I not drunk of Soma juice?<br> 12 1, greatest of the Mighty Ones, am lifted to the firmament:<br> Have I not drunk of Soma juice?<br> 13 I seek the worshipper's abode; oblation-bearer to the Gods:<br> Have I not drunk of Soma juice?</p>
