<TD><P>YAHSHUA went unto the mount of Olives.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And early in the morning he came again into    
the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught       
them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And the  
scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they 
had set her in the midst,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the 
very act.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Now  
Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest      
thou?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>This     
they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But YAHSHUA        
stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them  
not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>So when   
they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is 
without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And again he stooped down, and      
wrote on the ground.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went   
out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and YAHSHUA was    
left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>When YAHSHUA had lifted up        
himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those   
thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>She said, No man, ADONAY. And YAHSHUA said unto 
her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Then spake YAHSHUA again unto     
them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk  
in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou  
bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA answered and said unto    
them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence  
I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I       
go.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye judge 
after the flesh; I judge no man.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16>   
<H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not    
alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>It is also written in your law, that the        
testimony of two men is true.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>  
18</H4></TD><TD><P>I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that    
sent me beareth witness of me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4> 
19</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? YAHSHUA        
answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have 
known my Father also.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>These words spake YAHSHUA in the treasury, as he taught in the      
temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said YAHSHUA    
again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: 
whither I go, ye cannot come.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>  
22</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith,  
Whither I go, ye cannot come.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>  
23</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: 
ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die 
in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said they  
unto him, Who art thou? And YAHSHUA saith unto them, Even the same that I said  
unto you from the beginning.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>   
26</H4></TD><TD><P>I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that   
sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of    
him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>They    
understood not that he spake to them of the Father.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said YAHSHUA unto them, When 
ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I   
do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And he that     
sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those    
things that please him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>As he spake these words, many believed on him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said YAHSHUA to those Jews   
which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples      
indeed;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>They answered him, We be      
Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall 
be made free?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>YAHSHUA answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth  
sin is the servant of sin.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>     
35</H4></TD><TD><P>And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the   
Son abideth ever.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>I know that ye  
are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in    
you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>I speak 
that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with   
your father.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>
They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. YAHSHUA saith unto      
them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>But now ye seek to   
kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of ELOHIYM:     
this did not Abraham.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not    
born of fornication; we have one Father, even EL.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA said unto them, If EL     
were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from         
ELOHIYM; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>Why do ye not understand my       
speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts  
of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not  
in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he      
speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P>And because I tell you the    
truth, ye believe me not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46><H4>      
46</H4></TD><TD><P>Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth,   
why do ye not believe me?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>      
47</H4></TD><TD><P>He that is of ELOHIYM heareth EL's words: ye therefore hear  
them not, because ye are not of EL.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V48>
<H4>48</H4></TD><TD><P>Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not    
well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V49><H4>49</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA answered, I have not a    
devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V50><H4>50</H4></TD><TD><P>And I seek not mine own glory:    
there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V51><H4>51</H4></TD><TD><P>Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep   
my saying, he shall never see death.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V52><H4>52</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that   
thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man 
keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V53><H4>53</H4></TD><TD><P>Art thou greater than our father Abraham,    
which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V54><H4>54</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA answered, If 
I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of    
whom ye say, that he is your ELOHIYM:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V55><H4>55</H4></TD><TD><P>Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and  
if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know    
him, and keep his saying.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V56><H4>      
56</H4></TD><TD><P>Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it,   
and was glad.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V57><H4>57</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou 
seen Abraham?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V58><H4>58</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>YAHSHUA said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was,  
I am.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V59><H4>59</H4></TD><TD><P>Then   
took they up stones to cast at him: but YAHSHUA hid himself, and went out of    
the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</P></TD></TR>
