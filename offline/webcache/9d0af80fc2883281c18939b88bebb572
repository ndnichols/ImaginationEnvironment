<p>1 WHAT deed hath Indra done in the wild transport, in quaffing or in friendship with, the Soma?<br> What joys have men of ancient times or recent obtained within the chamber of libation?<br> 2 In its wild joy Indra hath proved him faithful, faithful in quaffing, faithful in its friendship.<br> His truth is the delight that in this chamber the men of old and recent times have tasted.<br> 3 All thy vast power, O Maghavan, we know not, know not the riches of thy full abundance.<br> No one hath seen that might of thine, productive of bounty every day renewed, O Indra.<br> 4 This one great power of thine our eyes have witnessed, wherewith thou slewest Varasikha's children,<br> When by the force of thy descending thunder, at the mere solund, their boldest was demolished.<br> 5 In aid of Abhyavartin Cayamana, Indra destroyed the seed of Varasikha.<br> At Hariyupiya he smote the vanguard of the Vrcivans, and the rear fled frighted.<br> 6 Three thousand, mailed, in quest of fame, together, on the Yavyavati, O much-sought Indra,<br> Vrcivan's sons, falling before the arrow, like bursting vessels went to their destruction.<br> 7 He, whose two red Steers, seeking goodly pasture, plying their tongues move on 'twixt earth and heaven,<br> Gave Turva&#347;a to S&#7771;&ntilde;jaya, and, to aid him, gave the Vrcivans up to Daivavata.<br> 8 Two wagon-teams, with damsels, twenty oxen, O Agni, Abhydvartin Cayamdna,<br> The liberal Sovran, giveth me. This guerdon of Prthu's seed is hard to win from others.</p>
