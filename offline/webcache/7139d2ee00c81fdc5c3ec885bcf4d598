<p>1. MAY he who hath his home with strength, the Mighty, the King supreme of earth and spacious heaven,<br> Lord of true power, to he invoked in battles,&#151;may Indra, girt by Maruts, be our succour.<br> 2 Whose way is unattainable like S&#363;rya's: he in each fight is the strong V&#7771;tra-slayer,<br> Mightiest with his Friends in his own courses. May Indra, girt by Maruts, be our succour.<br> 3 Whose paths go forth in their great might resistless, forthmilking, as it were, heaven's genial moisture.<br> With manly strength triumphant, foe-subduer,&#151;may Indra, girt by Maruts, be our succour.<br> 4 Among A&#7749;girases he was the chiefest, a Friend with friends, mighty amid the mighty.<br> Praiser mid praisers, honoured most of singers. May Indra, girt by Maruts, be our succour.<br> 5 Strong with the Rudras as with his own children, in manly battle conquering his foemen '<br> With his close comrades doing deeds of glory,&#151;may Indra, girt by Maruts, be our succour.<br> 6 Humbler of pride, exciter of the conflict, the Lord of heroes, God invoked of many,<br> May he this day gain with our men the sunlight. May Indra, girt by Maruts, be our succour.<br> 7 His help hath made him cheerer in the battle, the folk have made him guardian of their comfort.<br> Sole Lord is he of every holy service. May Indra, girt by Maruts, be our succour.<br> 8 To him the Hero, on high days of prowess, heroes for help and booty shall betake them.<br> He hath found light even in the blinding darkness. May Indra, girt by Maruts, be our succour.<br> 9 He with his left hand checketh even the mighty, and with his right hand gathereth up the booty.<br> Even with the humble he acquireth riches. May Indra, girt by Maruts, be our succour.<br> 10 With hosts on foot and cars he winneth treasures: well is he known this day by all the people.<br> With manly might he conquereth those who hate him. May Indra, girt by Maruts, be our succour.<br> 11 When in his ways with kinsmen or with strangers he speedeth to the fight, invoked of many,<br> For gain of waters, and of sons and grandsons, may Indra, girt by Maruts, be our succour.<br> 12 Awful and fierce, fiend-slayer, thunder-wielder, with boundless knowledge, hymned by hundreds, mighty,<br> In strength like Soma, guard of the Five Peoples, may Indra, girt by Maruts, be our succour.<br> 13 Winning the light, hitherward roars his thunder like the terrific mighty voice of Heaven.<br> Rich gifts and treasures evermore attend him. May Indra, girt by Maruts, be our succour.<br> 14 Whose home eternal through his strength surrounds him on every side, his laud, the earth and heaven,<br> May he, delighted with our service, save us. May Indra, girt by Maruts, be our succour.<br> 15 The limit of whose power not Gods by Godhead, nor mortal men have reached, nor yet the Waters.<br> Both Earth and Heaven in vigour he surpasseth. May Indra, girt by Maruts, he our succour.<br> 16 The red and tawny mare, blaze-marked, high standing, celestial who, to bring &#7770;jr&#257;&#347;va riches,<br> Drew at the pole the chariot yoked with stallions, joyous, among the hosts of men was noted.<br> 17 The V&#257;r&#7779;&#257;giras unto thee, O Indra, the Mighty One, sing forth this laud to please thee,<br> &#7770;jr&#257;&#347;va with his fellows, Ambar&#299;&#7779;a, Sur&#257;dhas, Sahadeva, Bhayam&#257;na.<br> 18 He, much invoked, hath slain Dasyus and &#346;imyus, after his wont, and laid them low with arrows.<br> The mighty Thunderer with his fair-complexioned friends won the land, the sunlight, and the waters.<br> 19 May Indra evermore be our protector, and unimperilled may we win the booty.<br> This prayer of ours may Varu&#7751;a grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu, Earth and Heaven.</p>
