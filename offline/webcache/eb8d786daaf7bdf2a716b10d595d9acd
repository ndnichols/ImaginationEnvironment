<p>1. LAID like an arrow on the bow the hymn hath been loosed like a young calf to the udder of its dam.<br> As one who cometh first with full stream she is milked the Soma is impelled to this man's holy rites.<br> 2 The thought is deeply fixed; the savoury juice is shed; the tongue with joyous sound is stirring in the mouth;<br> And Pavamana, like the shout of combatants, the drop rising in sweet juice, is flowing through the fleece.<br> 3 He flows about the sheep-skin, longing for a bride: he looses Aditi's Daughters for the worshipper.<br> The sacred drink hath come, gold-tinted, well-restrained: like a strong Bull he shines, whetting his manly might.<br> 4 The Bull is bellowing; the Cows are coming nigh: the Goddesses approach the God's own resting-place.<br> Onward hath Soma passed through the sheep's fair bright fleece, and hath, as &#146;twere, endued a garment newly washed.<br> 5 The golden-hued, Immortal, newly bathed, puts on a brightly shining vesture that is never harmed.<br> He made the ridge of heaven to be his radiant robe, by sprinkling of the bowls from moisture of the sky.<br> 6 Even as the beams of S&#363;rya, urging men to speed, that cheer and send to sleep, together rush they forth,<br> These swift outpourings in long course of holy rites: no form save only Indra shows itself so pure.<br> 7 As down the steep slope of a river to the vale, drawn from the Steer the swift strong draughts have found a way.<br> Well be it with the men and cattle in our home. May powers, O Soma, may the people stay with us.<br> 8 Pour out upon us wealth in goods, in gold, in steeds, in cattle and in corn, and great heroic strength.<br> Ye, Soma, are my Fathers, lifted up on high as heads of heaven and makers of the strength of life.<br> 9 These Pavamanas here, these drops of Soma, to Indra have sped forth like cars to booty.<br> Effused, they pass the cleansing fleece, while, gold-hued, they cast their covering off to pour the rain down.<br> 10 O Indu, flow thou on for lofty Indra, flow blameless, very gracious, foe-destroyer.<br> Bring splendid treasures to the man who lauds thee. O Heaven and Earth, with all the Gods protect. us.</p>
