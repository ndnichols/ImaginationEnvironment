Chapter 4</H1></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto 
him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and  
the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And he taught them many things by parables,    
and said unto them in his doctrine,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3> 
<H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass,   
as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and       
devoured it up.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately  
it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and  
because it had no root, it withered away.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew   
up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And other fell on good ground, and did yield      
fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some    
sixty, and some an hundred.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>     
9</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him     
hear.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the    
parable.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of   
EL: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables:</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>That seeing     
they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand;  
lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven    
them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And he 
said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all         
parables?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>   
The sower soweth the word.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>     
15</H4></TD><TD><P>And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown;  
but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word    
that was sown in their hearts.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4> 
16</H4></TD><TD><P>And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground;  
who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And have no     
root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or 
persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And these are they   
which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And the cares of this world, and  
the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke   
the word, and it becometh unfruitful.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And these are they which are sown on good       
ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some      
thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to   
be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>For there is    
nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret,  
but that it should come abroad.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>
23</H4></TD><TD><P>If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, Take   
heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and  
unto you that hear shall more be given.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he 
that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, So is the    
kingdom of EL, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And should sleep, and rise    
night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>For the earth   
bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the  
full corn in the ear.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the  
sickle, because the harvest is come.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the       
kingdom of EL? or with what comparison shall we compare it?</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>It is like a grain of mustard 
seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be   
in the earth:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and 
shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the   
shadow of it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able   
to hear it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P> 
But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he      
expounded all things to his disciples.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And the same day, when the even was come, he    
saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they had sent away the   
multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with   
him other little ships.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the  
ship, so that it was now full.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4> 
38</H4></TD><TD><P>And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a       
pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we   
perish?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the 
wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful?   
how is it that ye have no faith?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41>   
<H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another,    
What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</P></TD>
