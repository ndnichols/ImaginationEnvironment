James, a servant of ELOHIYM and of the ADONAY YAHSHUA MASHIYACH, to the twelve  
tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into   
divers temptations;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>But let patience have  
her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>If any of you lack     
wisdom, let him ask of ELOHIYM, that giveth to all men liberally, and           
upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For   
he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>For let not that  
man think that he shall receive any thing of YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>A double minded man is unstable in  
all his ways.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>But the rich, in that he is   
made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>For the sun is no sooner  
risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof   
falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich   
man fade away in his ways.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>     
12</H4></TD><TD><P>Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is  
tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which YHVH hath promised to them     
that love him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of ELOHIYM: for EL cannot be 
tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>But every man is tempted, when he is drawn   
away of his own lust, and enticed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15> 
<H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin:    
and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Do not err, my beloved            
brethren.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the  
Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Of his own will 
begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of  
his creatures.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to      
speak, slow to wrath:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of ELOHIYM.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore lay   
apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness  
the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>But be ye doers of the word, and  
not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a   
doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>For he beholdeth himself, 
and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>But whoso       
looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a 
forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his      
deed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>If any 
man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth  
his own heart, this man's religion is vain.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>Pure religion and undefiled before ELOHIYM and  
the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and 
to keep himself unspotted from the world.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This
