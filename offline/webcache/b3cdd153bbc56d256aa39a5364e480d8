<p>1. Now, verily, will I declare the exploits, mighty and true, of him the True and Mighty.<br> In the Trikadrukas he drank the Soma: then in its rapture Indra slew the Dragon.<br> 2 High heaven unsupported in space he stablished: he filled the two worlds and the air's mid-region.<br> Earth he upheld, and gave it wide expansion. These things did Indra in the Soma's rapture.<br> 3 From front, as &#146;twere a house, he ruled and measured; pierced with his bolt the fountains of the rivers,<br> And made them flow at ease by paths far-reaching, These things did Indra in the Soma's rapture.<br> 4 Compassing those who bore away Dabh&#299;ti, in kindled fire he burnt up all their weapons.<br> And made him rich with kine and cars and horses. These things did Indra in the Soma's rapture.<br> 5 The mighty roaring flood he stayed from flowing, and carried those who swam not safely over.<br> They having crossed the stream attained to riches. These things did Indra in the Soma's rapture.<br> 6 With mighty power he made the stream flow upward, crushed with his thunderbolt the car of U&#7779;as,<br> Rending her slow steeds with his rapid coursers. These things did Indra in the Soma's rapture.<br> 7 Knowing the place wherein the maids were hiding, the outcast showed himself and stood before them.<br> The cripple stood erect, the blind beheld them. These things did Indra in the Soma's rapture.<br> 8 Praised by the A&#7749;girases he slaughtered Vala, and burst apart the bulwarks of the mountain.<br> He tore away their deftly-built defences. These things did Indra in the Soma's rapture.<br> 9 Thou, with sleep whelming Cumuri and Dhuni, slewest the Dasyu, keptest safe Dabh&#299;ti.<br> There the staff-bearer found the golden treasure. These things did Indra in the Soma's rapture.<br> 10 Now let that wealthy Cow of thine, O Indra , yield in return a boon to him who lauds thee.<br> Give to thy praisers: let not fortune fail us. Loud may we speak, with brave men, in assembly.</p>
