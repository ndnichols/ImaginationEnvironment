<TD><P>After these things YAHSHUA walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in   
Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at         
hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>His      
brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy    
disciples also may see the works that thou doest.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>For there is no man that doeth any  
thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these    
things, shew thyself to the world.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5>  
<H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>For neither did his brethren believe in him.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Then YAHSHUA said unto      
them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>The world cannot hate you; but  
me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Go ye up unto this     
feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my time is not yet full come.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>When he had said  
these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>But when his brethren were gone   
up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in          
secret.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Then 
the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And there was much murmuring      
among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said,  
Nay; but he deceiveth the people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13>  
<H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the       
Jews.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Now    
about the midst of the feast YAHSHUA went up into the temple, and taught.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And the Jews    
marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA answered     
them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>If any man will do his will,  
he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of ELOHIYM, or whether I speak of  
myself.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>He   
that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory   
that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Did not Moses give you    
the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>The people      
answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA answered and 
said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Moses therefore gave unto you     
circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the   
sabbath day circumcise a man.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>  
23</H4></TD><TD><P>If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the   
law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a    
man every whit whole on the sabbath day?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Judge not according to the appearance, but      
judge righteous judgment.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>      
25</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom    
they seek to kill?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the       
rulers know indeed that this is the very MASHIYACH?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>Howbeit we know this man whence   
he is: but when MASHIYACH cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Then cried YAHSHUA in the     
temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am 
not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>But I know him: for I am  
from him, and he hath sent me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4> 
30</H4></TD><TD><P>Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him,  
because his hour was not yet come.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31> 
<H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And many of the people believed on him, and said, When   
MASHIYACH cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath       
done?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>The    
Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the    
Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said YAHSHUA unto them, Yet  
a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye shall seek me, and     
shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said the Jews among          
themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the 
dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>What manner of saying is this     
that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither  
ye cannot come?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD>
<P>In the last day, that great day of the feast, YAHSHUA stood and cried,       
saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>He that believeth on me, as   
the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>(But this spake 
he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy   
Ghost was not yet given; because that YAHSHUA was not yet glorified.)</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>Many of the people   
therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the            
Prophet.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Others said, This is the MASHIYACH. But some said, Shall MASHIYACH come out of  
Galilee?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Hath not the scripture said, That MASHIYACH cometh of the seed of David, and    
out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>So there was a division among the people     
because of him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P>Then came the        
officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have  
ye not brought him?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46><H4>46</H4></TD>
<TD><P>The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>47</H4></TD><TD><P>Then answered them the        
Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V48>   
<H4>48</H4></TD><TD><P>Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on   
him?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V49><H4>49</H4></TD><TD><P>But     
this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V50><H4>50</H4></TD><TD><P>Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to  
YAHSHUA by night, being one of them,)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A
