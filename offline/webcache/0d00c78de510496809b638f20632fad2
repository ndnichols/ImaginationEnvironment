<p>1. I PRAISE your Charioteer of sacrifice, the Lord of men, Priest of the tribes, refulgent, Guest of night.<br> Blazing amid dry plants, snatching amid the green, the Strong, the Holy Herald hath attained to heaven.<br> 2 Him, Agni, Gods and men have made their chief support, who drinks the fatness and completes the sacrifice.<br> With kisses they caress the Grandson of the Red, like the swift ray of light, the Household Priest of Dawn.<br> 3 Yea, we discriminate his and the niggard's ways: his branches evermore are sent forth to consume.<br> When his terrific flames have reached the Immortal's world, then men remember and extol the Heavenly Folk.<br> 4 For then the net of Law, Dyaus, and the wide expanse, Earth, Worship, and Devotion meet for highest praise,<br> Varu&#7751;a, Indra, Mitra were of one accord, and Savitar and Bhaga, Lords of holy might.<br> 5 Onward, with ever-roaming Rudra, speed the floods: over Aramati the Mighty have they run.<br> With them Parijman, moving round his vast domain, loud bellowing, bedews all things that are within.<br> 6 Straightway the Rudras, Maruts visiting all men, Falcons of Dyaus, home-dwellers with the Asura,&#151;<br> Varu&#7751;a, Mitra, Aryaman look on with these, and the swift-moving Indra with swift-moving Gods.<br> 7 With Indra have they found enjoyment, they who toil, in the light's beauty, in the very Strong One's strength;<br> The singers who in men's assemblies forged for him, according to his due, his friend the thunderbolt.<br> 8 Even the Sun's Bay Coursers hath lie held in check: each one fears Indra as the mightiest of all.<br> Unhindered, from the air's vault thunders day by day the loud triumphant breathing of the fearful Bull.<br> 9 With humble adoration show this day your song of praise to mighty Rudra, Ruler of the brave:<br> With whom, the Eager Ones, going their ordered course, he comes from heaven Self-bright, auspicious, strong to guard.<br> 10 For these have spread abroad the fame of human kind, the Bull B&#7771;haspati and Soma's brotherhood.<br> Atharvan first by sacrifices made men sure: through skill the Bh&#7771;gus were esteemed of all as Gods.<br> 11 For these, the Earth and Heaven with their abundant seed, four-bodied Nar&#257;&#347;a&#7745;sa, Yama, Aditi,<br> God Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar Wealth-bestower, the &#7770;bhuk&#7779;a&#7751;as, Rodas&#299;, Maruts, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, claim and merit praise.<br> 12 And may he too give car, the Sage, from far away, the Dragon of the Deep, to this our yearning call.<br> Ye Sun and Moon who dwell in heaven and move in turn, and with your thought, O Earth and Sky, observe this well.<br> 13 Dear to all Gods, may P&#363;&#7779;an guard the ways we go, the Waters&#146; child and V&#257;yu help us to success.<br> Sing lauds for your great bliss to Wind, the breath of all: ye A&#347;vins prompt to hear, hear this upon your way.<br> 14 With hymns of praise we sing him who is throned as Lord over these fearless tribes, the Self-resplendent One.<br> We praise Night's youthful Lord benevolent to men, the foeless One, the free, with all celestial Dames.<br> 15 By reason of his birth here A&#7749;giras first sang: the pressing-stones upraised beheld the sacrifice-<br> The stones through which the Sage became exceeding vast, and the sharp axe obtains in fight the beauteous place.</p>
