<TD><P>And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the   
servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them  
two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred  
of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by 
these? And Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on; and the 
bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be  
faint in the wilderness may drink.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3>  
<H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And     
Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To day   
shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said the king to Ziba,     
Behold, thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly 
beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And when king David came to 
Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul,      
whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he   
came.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And he   
cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people 
and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And thus said Shimei when he    
cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial:</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>YHVH hath returned     
upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; 
and YHVH hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and,      
behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a bloody man.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said Abishai the  
son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king?  
let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And the king said, What have I to 
do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because YHVH hath said unto  
him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And David said to         
Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my        
bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him    
alone, and let him curse; for YHVH hath bidden him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>It may be that YHVH will look on  
mine affliction, and that YHVH will requite me good for his cursing this        
day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And as  
David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill's side over    
against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And the king,   
and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves     
there.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and           
Ahithophel with him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was   
come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, save the king, save the       
king.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou    
not with thy friend?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom YHVH, and this people,  
and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And again, whom 
should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served 
in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said Absalom to Ahithophel,  
Give counsel among you what we shall do.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto    
thy father's concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel   
shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all    
that are with thee be strong.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>  
22</H4></TD><TD><P>So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and 
Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And the counsel 
of Ahithophel, which he counseled in those days, was as if a man had inquired   
at the oracle of ELOHIYM: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David  
and with Absalom.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by
