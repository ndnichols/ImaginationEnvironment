Then shall they cry unto YHVH, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his 
face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their       
doings.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus   
saith YHVH concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with

even prepare war against him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>
