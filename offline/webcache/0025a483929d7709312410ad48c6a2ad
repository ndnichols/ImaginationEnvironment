<p>1. WHAT may we meditate for the beloved Power, mighty in native strength and glorious in itself,<br> Which as a magic energy seeking waters spreads even to theimmeasurable middle region's cloud?<br> 2 O'er all the region with their uniform advance these have spread out the lore that giveth heroes strength.<br> Back, with their course reversed, the others pass away: the pious lengthens life with those that are before.<br> 3 With pressing-stones and with the bright beams of the day he hurls his broadest bolt against the Guileful One.<br> Even he whose hundred wander in his own abode, driving the days afar and bringing them again.<br> 4 I, to enjoy the beauty of his form, behold that rapid rush of his as &#146;twere an axe's edge,<br> What time he gives the man who calls on him in fight wealth like a dwelling-house filled full with store of food.<br> 5 Four-faced and nobly clad, Varu&#7751;a, urging on the pious to his task, stirs himself with the tongue.<br> Naught by our human nature do we know of him, him from whom Bhaga Savitar bestows the boon.</p>
