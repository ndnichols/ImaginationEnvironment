<TD><P>I saw the ADONAY standing upon the altar: and he said, Smite the lintel  
of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in the head, all of them;   
and I will slay the last of them with the sword: he that fleeth of them shall   
not flee away, and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Though they dig into   
hell, thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, thence  
will I bring them down:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search 
and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of 
the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them:</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And though they go     
into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it    
shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for       
good.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And the  
ADONAY YHVH of hosts is he that toucheth the land, and it shall melt, and all   
that dwell therein shall mourn: and it shall rise up wholly like a flood; and   
shall be drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: YHVH is his name.</P></TD>

of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith YHVH. Have not I brought 
up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the   
Syrians from Kir?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD>
<P>Behold, the eyes of the ADONAY YHVH are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will  
destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not utterly       
destroy the house of Jacob, saith YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

house of Israel among all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall 
not the least grain fall upon the earth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and  
I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old:</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>That they may        
possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, which are called by my

the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.</P></TD></TR>

the captivity of my people of Israel, and they shall build the waste cities,    
and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof;   
they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

them, saith YHVH thy ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
