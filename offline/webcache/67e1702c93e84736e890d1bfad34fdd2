No man hath seen ELOHIYM at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the

No.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Then     
said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent  
us. What sayest thou of thyself?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23>   
<H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness,

the Pharisees.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be

VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>John answered them, saying, I     
baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>He it is, who coming

unloose.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>    
These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>The next day    
John seeth YAHSHUA coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of ELOHIYM,      
which taketh away the sin of the world.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And I knew him not: but that he   
should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And John bare   
record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it     
abode upon him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said 
unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him,  
the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

this is the Son of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>    
35</H4></TD><TD><P>Again the next day after John stood, and two of his          
disciples;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And looking upon YAHSHUA as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of ELOHIYM!</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And the two     
disciples heard him speak, and they followed YAHSHUA.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>Then YAHSHUA turned, and saw them 
following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which 
is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>He saith unto them, Come and  
see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was  
about the tenth hour.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was        
Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4> 
41</H4></TD><TD><P>He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him,  
We have found the MASHIYACH, which is, being interpreted, the ANOINTED.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>And he brought him   
to YAHSHUA. And when YAHSHUA beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of     
Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>The day following    
YAHSHUA would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him,    
Follow me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets,  
did write, YAHSHUA of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46><H4>46</H4></TD><TD><P>And Nathanael said unto him, Can  
there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and      
see.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>47</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA

whom is no guile!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V48><H4>48</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? YAHSHUA answered and

tree, I saw thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V49><H4>49</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of        
ELOHIYM; thou art the King of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

greater things than these.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V51><H4>

Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of ELOHIYM ascending and     
descending upon the Son of man.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
