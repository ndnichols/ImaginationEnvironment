<TD><P>And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the   
third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten   
Ziklag, and burned it with fire;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>
2</H4></TD><TD><P>And had taken the women captives, that were therein: they     
slew not any, either great or small, but carried them away, and went on their   
way.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>So David  
and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their   
wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Then David and the people   
that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power 
to weep.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail    
the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>
6</H4></TD><TD><P>And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of     
stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his  
sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in YHVH his            
ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray thee, bring me       
hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And David inquired at YHVH, 
saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered 
him, Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake them, and without fail recover      
all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>So David  
went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook      
Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>But David pursued, he and four    
hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint that they could  
not go over the brook Besor.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>   
11</H4></TD><TD><P>And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to  
David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water;</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And they gave   
him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had     
eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any   
water, three days and three nights.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13>
<H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and     
whence art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an          
Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone I fell sick.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>We made an invasion  
upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah, 
and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And David said to him, Canst  
thou bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by ELOHIYM, that 
thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I    
will bring thee down to this company.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he had brought him down, behold, they  
were spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing,        
because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the       
Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And David smote them from the twilight even     
unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save     
four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And David recovered all that the  
Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And there was nothing lacking 
to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil,    
nor any thing that they had taken to them: David recovered all.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And David took all the    
flocks and the herds, which they drave before those other cattle, and said,     
This is David's spoil.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that     
they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook      
Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with 
him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Then answered all the wicked  
men and men of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they    
went not with us, we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have         
recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them 
away, and depart.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which YHVH   
hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that came       
against us into our hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>      
24</H4></TD><TD><P>For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his     
part is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarrieth by    
the stuff: they shall part alike.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25>  
<H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a   
statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And when David came to Ziklag, he 
sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold 
a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of YHVH;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>To them which were in Bethel, and 
to them which were in south Ramoth, and to them which were in Jattir,</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And to them which    
were in Aroer, and to them which were in Siphmoth, and to them which were in    
Eshtemoa,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And to them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in the cities of the   
Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the cities of the Kenites,</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And to them which

Athach,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
to them which were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his 
men were wont to haunt.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright
