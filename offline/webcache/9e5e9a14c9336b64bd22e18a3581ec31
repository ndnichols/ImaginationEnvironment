him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>By this   
we know that we love the children of ELOHIYM, when we love EL, and keep his     
commandments.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P> 
For this is the love of ELOHIYM, that we keep his commandments: and his         
commandments are not grievous.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>

this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.</P></TD></TR><TR>

water and blood, even YAHSHUA MASHIYACH; not by water only, but by water and    
blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is         
truth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>For     
there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy

believeth not the record that EL gave of his Son.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing       
according to his will, he heareth us:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him  
life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say  
that he shall pray for it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>
