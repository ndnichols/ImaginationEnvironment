<p>1. THOU, Soma, hast a running stream, joyous, most strong at sacrifice:<br> Flow bounteously bestowing wealth.<br> 2 Effused as cheerer of the men, flowing best gladdener, thou art<br> A Prince to Indra with thy juice.<br> 3 Poured forth by pressing-stones, do thou with loud roar send us in a stream<br> Most excellent illustrious might.<br> 4 Indu, urged forward, floweth through the fleecy cloth: the Tawny One<br> With his loud roar hath brought as strength.<br> 5 Indu, thou flowest through the fleece, bringing felicities and fame,<br> And, Soma, spoil and wealth in kine.<br> 6 Hither, O Indu, bring us wealth in steeds and cattle hundredfold:<br> Bring wealth, O Soma, thousandfold.<br> 7 In purifying, through the sieve the rapid drops of'Soma juice<br> Come nigh to Indra in their course.<br> 8 For Indra floweth excellent Indu, the noblest Soma juice<br> The Living for the Living One.<br> 9 The glittering maids send S&#363;ra forth they with their song have sung aloud<br> To Pavamana dropping meath.<br> 10 May P&#363;&#7779;an, drawn by goats, be our protector, and on all his paths<br> Bestow on us our share of maids.<br> 11 This Soma flows like gladdening oil for him who wears the braided locks:<br> He shall give us our share of maids.<br> 12 This Soma juice, O glowing God, flows like pure oil, effused for thee:<br> He shall give us our share of maids.<br> 13 Flow onward, Soma, in thy stream, begetter of the sages' speech:<br> Wealth-giver among Gods art thou.<br> 14 The Falcon dips within the jars: he wrap&#7717;im in his robe and goes<br> Loud roaring to the vats of wood.<br> 15 Soma, thy juice hath been effused and poured into the pitcher: like<br> A rapid hawk it rushes on.<br> 16 For Indra flow most rich in sweets, O Soma, bringing him delight.<br> 17 They were sent forth to feast the Gods, like chariots that display their strength.<br> 18 Brilliant, best givers of delight, these juices have sent V&#257;yu forth.<br> 19 Bruised by the press-stones and extolled, Soma, thou goest to the sieve,<br> Giving the worshipper hero strength.<br> 20 This juice bruised by the pressing-stones and lauded passes through the sieve,<br> Slayer of demons, through the fleece.<br> 21 O Pavamana, drive away the danger, whether near at hand<br> Or far remote, that finds me here.<br> 22 This day may Pavamana cleanse us with his purifying power,<br> Most active purifying Priest.<br> 23 O Agni, with the cleansing light diffused through all thy fiery glow,<br> Purify thou this prayer of ours.<br> 24 Cleanse us with thine own cleansing power, O Agni, that is bright with flame,<br> And by libations poured to thee.<br> 25 Savitar, God, by both of these, libation, purifying power,<br> Purify me on every side.<br> 26 Cleanse us, God Savitar, with Three, O Soma, with sublimest forms,<br> Agni, with forms of power and might.<br> 27 May the Gods&#146; company make me clean, and Vasus make rue pure by song.<br> Purify me, ye General Gods; O J&#257;tavedas, make me pure.<br> 28 Fill thyself full of juice, flow forth, O Soma, thou with all thy stalks,<br> The best oblation to the Gods.<br> 29 We with our homage have approached the Friend who seeks our wondering praise,<br> Young, strengthener of the solemn rite.<br> 30 Lost is Alayya's axe. O Soma, God do thou send it back hither in thy flow<br> Even, Soma, God, if &#146;twere a mole.<br> 31 The man who reads the essence stored by saints, the Pavamani hymns,<br> Tastes food completely purified, made sweet by M&#257;tari&#347;van's touch.<br> 32 Whoever reads the essence stored by saints, the Pavamani hymns,<br> Sarasvat&#299; draws forth for him water and butter, milk and meath.</p>
