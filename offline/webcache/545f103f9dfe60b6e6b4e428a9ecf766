brethren, have not the faith of our ADONAY YAHSHUA MASHIYACH, of glory, with    
respect of persons.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly   
apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And ye have respect to him that 
weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and  
say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Are ye not then partial in  
yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath  
not ELOHIYM chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the       
kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>But ye have despised the poor. Do   
not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Do not they blaspheme that  
worthy name by the which ye are called?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>If ye fulfil the royal law according to the       
scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>But if ye have respect to   
persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>For whosoever shall  
keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>For he that said, Do 
not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery,    
yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>So speak ye, and so do, as    
they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

judgment.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>   
What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not  
works? can faith save him?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>     
15</H4></TD><TD><P>If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily      
food,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled;             
notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body;    
what doth it profit?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Yea, a man may say,  
Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I   
will shew thee my faith by my works.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou believest that there is one ELOHIYM; thou  
doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>But wilt thou know, O vain man,   
that faith without works is dead?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21>  
<H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he   
had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Seest thou how faith wrought with his works,    
and by works was faith made perfect?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And the scripture was fulfilled which saith,    
Abraham believed YHVH, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he    
was called the Friend of YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4> 
24</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by 
faith only.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had         
received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>For as the body without the   
spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
