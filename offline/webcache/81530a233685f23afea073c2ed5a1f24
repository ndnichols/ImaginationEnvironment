<p>1. THOUGH holding many gifts for men, he humbleth the higher powers of each wise ordainer.<br> Agni is now the treasure-lord of treasures, for ever granting all immortal bounties.<br> 2 The Gods infallible all searching found not him, the dear Babe who still is round about us.<br> Worn weary, following his track, devoted, they reached the lovely highest home of Agni.<br> 3 Because with holy oil the pure Ones, Agni, served thee the very pure three autumn seasons,<br> Therefore they won them holy names for worship, and nobly born they dignified their bodies.<br> 4 Making them known to spacious earth and heaven, the holy Ones revealed the powers of Rudra.<br> The mortal band, discerning in the distance, found Agni standing in the loftiest station.<br> 5 Nigh they approached, one-minded, with their spouses, kneeling to him adorable paid worship.<br> Friend finding in his own friend's eye protection, they made their own the bodies which they chastened.<br> 6 Soon as the holy beings had discovered the thrice-seven mystic things contained within thee,<br> With these, one-minded, they preserve the Am&#7771;ta: guard thou the life of all their plants and cattle.<br> 7 Thou, Agni, knower of men's works, hast sent us good food in constant course for our subsistence:<br> Thou deeply skilled in paths of Gods becamest an envoy never wearied, offering-bearer.<br> 8 Knowing the Law, the seven strong floods from heaven, full of good thought, discerned the doors of riches.<br> Saram&#257; found the cattle's firm-built prison whereby the race of man is still supported.<br> 9 They who approached all noble operations making a path that leads to life immortal,<br> To be the Bird's support, the spacious mother, Aditi, and her great Sons stood in power.<br> 10 When Gods immortal made both eyes of heaven, they gave to him the gift of beauteous glory.<br> Now they flow forth like rivers set in motion: they knew the Red Steeds coming down, O Agni.</p>
