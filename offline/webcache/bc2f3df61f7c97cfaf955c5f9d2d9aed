<p>1 I WILL declare the manly deeds of Indra, the first that he achieved, the Thunder-wielder.<br> He slew the Dragon, then disclosed the waters, and cleft the channels of the mountain torrents.<br> 2 He slew the Dragon lying on the mountain: his heavenly bolt of thunder Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar fashioned.<br> Like lowing kine in rapid flow descending the waters glided downward to the ocean.<br> 3 Impetuous as a bull, he chose the Soma and in three sacred beakers drank the juices.<br> Maghavan grasped the thunder for his weapon, and smote to death this firstborn of the dragons.<br> 4 When, Indra, thou hadst slain the dragon's firstborn, and overcome the charms of the enchanters,<br> Then, giving life to Sun and Dawn and Heaven, thou foundest not one foe to stand against thee.<br> 5 Indra with his own great and deadly thunder smote into pieces V&#7771;tra, worst of V&#7771;tras.<br> As trunks of trees, what time the axe hath felled them, low on the earth so lies the prostrate Dragon.<br> 6 He, like a mad weak warrior, challenged Indra, the great impetuous many-slaying Hero.<br> He, brooking not the clashing of the weapons, crushed&#151;Indra's foe&#151;the shattered forts in falling.<br> 7 Footless and handless still he challenged Indra, who smote him with his bolt between the shoulders.<br> Emasculate yet claiming manly vigour, thus V&#7771;tra lay with scattered limbs dissevered.<br> 8 There as he lies like a bank-bursting river, the waters taking courage flow above him.<br> The Dragon lies beneath the feet of torrents which V&#7771;tra with his greatness had encompassed.<br> 9 Then humbled was the strength of V&#7771;tra's mother: Indra hath cast his deadly bolt against her.<br> The mother was above, the son was under and like a cow beside her calf lay Danu.<br> 10 Rolled in the midst of never-ceasing currents flowing without a rest for ever onward.<br> The waters bear off V&#7771;tra's nameless body: the foe of Indra sank to during darkness.<br> 11 Guarded by Ahi stood the thralls of D&#257;sas, the waters stayed like kine held by the robber.<br> But he, when he had smitten V&#7771;tra, opened the cave wherein the floods had been imprisoned.<br> 12 A horse's tail wast thou when he, O Indra, smote on thy bolt; thou, God without a second,<br> Thou hast won back the kine, hast won the Soma; thou hast let loose to flow the Seven Rivers.<br> 13 Nothing availed him lightning, nothing thunder, hailstorm or mist which had spread around him:<br> When Indra and the Dragon strove in battle, Maghavan gained the victory for ever.<br> 14 Whom sawest thou to avenge the Dragon, Indra, that fear possessed thy heart when thou hadst slain him;<br> That, like a hawk affrighted through the regions, thou crossedst nine-and-ninety flowing rivers?<br> 15 Indra is King of all that moves and moves not, of creatures tame and horned, the Thunder-wielder.<br> Over all living men he rules as Sovran, containing all as spokes within the felly.</p>
