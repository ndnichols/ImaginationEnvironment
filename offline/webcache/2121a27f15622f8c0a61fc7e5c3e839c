1</H4></TD><TD><P>The word of YHVH also came unto me, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Son of man, thou dwellest in    
the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to see, and see not; they have 
ears to hear, and hear not: for they are a rebellious house.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore, thou son of man,     
prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou     
shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they     
will consider, though they be a rebellious house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Then shalt thou bring forth thy     
stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing: and thou shalt go forth at  
even in their sight, as they that go forth into captivity.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Dig thou through the wall in their  
sight, and carry out thereby.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>   
6</H4></TD><TD><P>In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders, and     
carry it forth in the twilight: thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not    
the ground: for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And I did so as I was  
commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for captivity, and in the  
even I digged through the wall with mine hand; I brought it forth in the        
twilight, and I bare it upon my shoulder in their sight.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And in the morning came the word of 
YHVH unto me, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said     
unto thee, What doest thou?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>    
10</H4></TD><TD><P>Say thou unto them, Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH; This burden  
concerneth the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel that are among  
them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Say, I 
am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them: they shall    
remove and go into captivity.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>  
12</H4></TD><TD><P>And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his        
shoulder in the twilight, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall   
to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, that he see not the ground with  
his eyes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>My 
net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will  
bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it,     
though he shall die there.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>     
14</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him  
to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And they shall  
know that I am YHVH, when I shall scatter them among the nations, and disperse  
them in the countries.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, 
and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the 
heathen whither they come; and they shall know that I am YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover the word of YHVH     
came to me, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with         
trembling and with carefulness;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>
19</H4></TD><TD><P>And say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the ADONAY   
YHVH of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and of the land of Israel; They shall eat 
their bread with carefulness, and drink their water with astonishment, that her 
land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the violence of all   
them that dwell therein.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land 
shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I am YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And the word of YHVH came unto    
me, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Son of man, what is that proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying,    
The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Tell them therefore, Thus saith   
the ADONAY YHVH; I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use  
it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the     
effect of every vision.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering           
divination within the house of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>For I am YHVH: I will speak, and the word that  
I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for in your    
days, O rebellious house, will I say the word, and will perform it, saith the   
ADONAY YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>
Again the word of YHVH came to me, saying.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel 
say, The vision that he seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of   
the times that are far off.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>    
28</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH; There   
shall none of my words be prolonged any more, but the word which I have spoken  
shall be done, saith the ADONAY YHVH.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
