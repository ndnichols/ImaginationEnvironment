<TD><P>And YAHSHUA being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was   
led by the Spirit into the wilderness,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in     
those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward           
hungered.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of ELOHIYM, command this stone that 
it be made bread.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And YAHSHUA answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live by  
bread alone, but by every word of YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And the devil, taking him up into an high         
mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And the devil     
said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that 
is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>If thou therefore wilt worship me,  
all shall be thine.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And YAHSHUA answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for   
it is written, Thou shalt worship YHVH thy ELOHIYM, and him only shalt thou     
serve.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And he  
brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said     
unto him, If thou be the Son of ELOHIYM, cast thyself down from hence:</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>For it is written,   
He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt YHVH thy ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the devil had    
ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA returned in the   
power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all  
the region round about.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And he came to       
Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into    
the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And there was delivered unto  
him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found   
the place where it was written,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>
18</H4></TD><TD><P>The Spirit of the ADONAY YHVH is upon me, because YHVH hath  
anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the       
brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight   
to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>To preach the acceptable year of  
YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And he 
closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the    
eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And he began to say unto  
them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And all bare him witness, and     
wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, 
Is not this Joseph's son?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>      
23</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this       
proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum,   
do also here in thy country.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>   
24</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted   
in his own country.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD>
<TD><P>But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of     
Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great       
famine was throughout all the land;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26>
<H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, 
a city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And many lepers were in Israel in the time   
of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the        
Syrian.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with       
wrath,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill  
whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>But he passing       
through the midst of them went his way,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee,  
and taught them on the sabbath days.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And they were astonished at his doctrine: for   
his word was with power.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an      
unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do     
with thee, thou YAHSHUA of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee   
who thou art; the CHACIYD of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA rebuked him, saying, Hold thy       
peace, and come out of him. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he  
came out of him, and hurt him not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36> 
<H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves,    
saying, What a word is this! for with authority and power he commandeth the     
unclean spirits, and they come out.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37>
<H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And the fame of him went out into every place of the     
country round about.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house.  
And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever; and they besought him   
for her.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she  
arose and ministered unto them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>
40</H4></TD><TD><P>Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick     
with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one  
of them, and healed them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>      
41</H4></TD><TD><P>And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying,    
Thou art MASHIYACH the Son of ELOHIYM. And he rebuking them suffered them not   
to speak: for they knew that he was MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>And when it was day, he departed and went    
into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed   
him, that he should not depart from them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, I must preach the        
kingdom of EL to other cities also: for therefore am I sent.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>And he preached in the        
synagogues of Galilee.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000
