<TD><P>And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their   
armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David,  
Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy     
men.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And David 
said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do. And Achish said 
to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head for ever.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Now Samuel was dead, and    
all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And 
Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the  
land.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And the  
Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and   
Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And when Saul saw the host of   
the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And when Saul inquired of   
YHVH, YHVH answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by             
prophets.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Then 
said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that  
I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold,      
there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And Saul disguised himself, and put 
on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman 
by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and  
bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou      
knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar       
spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare   
for my life, to cause me to die?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10>   
<H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And Saul sware to her by YHVH, saying, As YHVH liveth,   
there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said the woman, Whom shall I 
bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the woman saw Samuel,    
she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou 
deceived me? for thou art Saul.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>
13</H4></TD><TD><P>And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest   
thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said     
unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is     
covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped    
with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou       
disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the 
Philistines make war against me, and ELOHIYM is departed from me, and answereth 
me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee,   
that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said Samuel, Wherefore then  
dost thou ask of me, seeing YHVH is departed from thee, and is become thine     
enemy?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
YHVH hath done to him, as he spake by me: for YHVH hath rent the kingdom out of 
thine hand, and given it to thy neighbor, even to David:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Because thou obeyedst not the     
voice of YHVH, nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath YHVH 
done this thing unto thee this day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19>
<H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover YHVH will also deliver Israel with thee into    
the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me:  
YHVH also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Saul fell  
straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words   
of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the  
day, nor all the night.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled,    
and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put 
my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto   
me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Now      
therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and 
let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have        
strength, when thou goest on thy way.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But   
his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto     
their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And the woman had a fat calf  
in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it,    
and did bake unleavened bread thereof:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And she brought it before Saul, and before his  
servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.</P>
