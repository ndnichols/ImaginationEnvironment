them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And    
there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his           
brethren.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And Joseph said unto his    
brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not      
answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And Joseph said unto his brethren,  
Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your  
brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5>

deliverance.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>  
So now it was not you that sent me hither, but ELOHIYM: and he hath made me a   
father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the    
land of Egypt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>
Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph,  
ELOHIYM hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not:</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And thou shalt dwell

hast:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine; lest thou,

you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And ye  
shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen;

</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And the fame    
thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and   
it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy

Canaan;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Now thou art commanded,   
this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and  
for your wives, and bring your father, and come.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Also regard not your stuff; for   
the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them        
provision for the way.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4>

he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And to his father he 
sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten  
she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>So he sent his

</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And they told him    
all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the       
wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father     
revived:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him
