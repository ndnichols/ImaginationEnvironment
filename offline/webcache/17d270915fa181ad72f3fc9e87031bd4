<TD><P>After this there was a feast of the Jews; and YAHSHUA went up to         
Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Now 
there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew 
tongue Bethesda, having five porches.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk,  
of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>For an angel went down at a     
certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first      
after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever        
disease he had.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight         
years.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>When    
YAHSHUA saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he 
saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no     
man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am        
coming, another steppeth down before me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed,    
and walk.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the 
same day was the sabbath.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>      
10</H4></TD><TD><P>The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the   
sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>He answered them, He that made me 
whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Then asked they him, What man is  
that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And he that was healed wist not   
who it was: for YAHSHUA had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that    
place.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>      
Afterward YAHSHUA findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou    
art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>The man departed, and     
told the Jews that it was YAHSHUA, which had made him whole.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And therefore did the Jews    
persecute YAHSHUA, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on  
the sabbath day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>But YAHSHUA answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore the   
Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath,   
but said also that ELOHIYM was his Father, making himself equal with EL.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Then answered   
YAHSHUA and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do      
nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he  
doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him  
all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these,   
that ye may marvel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD>
<TD><P>For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the  
Son quickeneth whom he will.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>   
22</H4></TD><TD><P>For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all        
judgment unto the Son:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. 
He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Verily, verily, 
I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me,     
hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from 
death unto life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the 
dead shall hear the voice of the Son of ELOHIYM: and they that hear shall       
live.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>For as 
the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in    
himself;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of     
man.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Marvel  
not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves    
shall hear his voice,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the            
resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of    
damnation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>I 
can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just;   
because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent    
me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>If I     
bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>There is another that beareth witness of me; 
and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye sent unto John, and he     
bare witness unto the truth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>   
34</H4></TD><TD><P>But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I     
say, that ye might be saved.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>   
35</H4></TD><TD><P>He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing    
for a season to rejoice in his light.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>But I have greater witness than that of John:   
for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I   
do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And the Father himself, which     
hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any  
time, nor seen his shape.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>      
38</H4></TD><TD><P>And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath    
sent, him ye believe not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>      
39</H4></TD><TD><P>Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal  
life: and they are they which testify of me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>And ye will not come to me, that ye might have  
life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>I      
receive not honour from men.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>   
42</H4></TD><TD><P>But I know you, that ye have not the love of ELOHIYM in      
you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>I am    
come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his   
own name, him ye will receive.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4> 
44</H4></TD><TD><P>How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and 
seek not the honour that cometh from ELOHIYM only?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P>Do not think that I will accuse   
you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye       
trust.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46><H4>46</H4></TD><TD><P>For   
had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>47</H4></TD><TD><P>But if ye believe    
not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This
