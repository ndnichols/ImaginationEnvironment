<TD><P>And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had    
slain all the prophets with the sword.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah,        
saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the  
life of one of them by to morrow about this time.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he saw that, he arose, and 
went for his life, and came to Beersheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left    
his servant there.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and    
sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die;  
and said, It is enough; now, O YHVH, take away my life; for I am not better     
than my fathers.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched  
him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake      
baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, 
and laid him down again.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And the angel of YHVH came again the second time, and touched him,  
and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And he arose, and did  
eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty       
nights unto Horeb the mount of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged       
there; and, behold, the word of YHVH came to him, and he said unto him, What    
doest thou here, Elijah?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And he said, I have been very jealous for YHVH ELOHIYM of hosts:    
for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine        
altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and 
they seek my life, to take it away.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11>
<H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before   
YHVH. And, behold, YHVH passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the         
mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before YHVH; but YHVH was not in the   
wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but YHVH was not in the earthquake:</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And after the   
earthquake a fire; but YHVH was not in the fire: and after the fire a still     
small voice.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>
And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle,    
and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came 
a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, I have been very     
jealous for YHVH ELOHIYM of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken 
thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword;  
and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH said unto   
him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, 
anoint Hazael to be king over Syria:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to 
be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt thou    
anoint to be prophet in thy room.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17>  
<H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the    
sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu   
shall Elisha slay.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have    
not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>So he departed thence,    
and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen   
before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his     
mantle upon him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray     
thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said    
unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And he returned back from him,    
and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the         
instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he    
arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
