</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>Having therefore  
these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of 
the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Receive us; we have wronged 
no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>I speak not this to condemn     
you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with     
you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Great is  
my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with 
comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>For, when we were come into         
Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without   
were fightings, within were fears.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6>  
<H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Nevertheless ELOHIYM, that comforteth those that are cast 
down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And not by his coming only, but by the            
consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest     
desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the      
more.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>For      
though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent:    
for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but    
for a season.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: 
for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us 
in nothing.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P> 
For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the 
sorrow of the world worketh death.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11> 
<H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a 
godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of           
yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire,   
yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to 
be clear in this matter.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that 
had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care    
for you in the sight of ELOHIYM might appear unto you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore we were comforted in    
your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus,      
because his spirit was refreshed by you all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>For if I have boasted any thing to him of you,  
I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our       
boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And his inward affection is more  
abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with   
fear and trembling ye received him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16>
<H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all 
things.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M.
