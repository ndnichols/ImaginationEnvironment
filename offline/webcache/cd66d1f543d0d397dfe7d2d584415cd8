Then said the high priest, Are these things so?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers,       
hearken; YHVH of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in         
Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country,   
and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Then came he out of    
the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his     
father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And he gave him none   
inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that  
he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as    
yet he had no child.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And ELOHIYM spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a        
strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them    
evil four hundred years.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said  
YHVH: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And he gave him the    
covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the   
eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And the           
patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but YHVH was with him,</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And delivered   
him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of  
Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his          
house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Now   
there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan, and great           
affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>But when Jacob heard that there   
was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And at the second time Joseph was 
made known to his brethren; and Joseph's kindred was made known unto            
Pharaoh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred,      
threescore and fifteen souls.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>  
15</H4></TD><TD><P>So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our         
fathers,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought    
for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>But when the time of the      
promise drew nigh, which ELOHIYM had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and      
multiplied in Egypt,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>The same dealt subtilly with  
our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young  
children, to the end they might not live.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding 
fair, and nourished up in his father's house three months:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he was cast out,         
Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses was learned in  
all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he was full 
forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of   
Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was      
oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25> 
<H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>For he supposed his brethren would have understood how   
that ELOHIYM by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And the next day he  
shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again,  
saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>But he that did his neighbour 
wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Wilt thou kill  
me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a       
stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And when forty years were         
expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of YHVH 
in a flame of fire in a bush.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>  
31</H4></TD><TD><P>When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew  
near to behold it, the voice of YHVH came unto him,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>Saying, I am the ELOHIYM of thy   
fathers, the ELOHIYM of Abraham, and the ELOHIYM of Isaac, and the ELOHIYM of   
Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said YHVH to him, Put off    
thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>I have seen, I  
have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their 
groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into 
Egypt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>This  
Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same    
did ELOHIYM send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which   
appeared to him in the bush.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>   
36</H4></TD><TD><P>He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and    
signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty     
years.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>This  
is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall YHVH     
your ELOHIYM raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye     
hear.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>This   
is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to   
him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to 
give unto us:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their   
hearts turned back again into Egypt,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before    
us: for as for this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot    
not what is become of him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>     
41</H4></TD><TD><P>And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice    
unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>Then ELOHIYM turned, and gave 
them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the      
prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and          
sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of 
Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship      
them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in 
the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make   
it according to the fashion that he had seen.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P>Which also our fathers that came after       
brought in with Joshua into the possession of the Gentiles, whom ELOHIYM drave  
out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46><H4>46</H4></TD><TD><P>Who found favour before       
ELOHIYM, and desired to find a tabernacle for the EL of Jacob.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>47</H4></TD><TD><P>But Solomon built him an      
house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V48><H4>48</H4></TD><TD><P>      
Howbeit the ELYOWN dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the        
prophet,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V49><H4>49</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will ye build me?    
saith YHVH: or what is the place of my rest?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V50><H4>50</H4></TD><TD><P>Hath not my hand made all these things?</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V51><H4>51</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye stiffnecked and   
uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your    
fathers did, so do ye.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V52><H4>52</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they    
have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye   
have been now the betrayers and murderers:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V53><H4>53</H4></TD><TD><P>Who have received the law by the disposition of 
angels, and have not kept it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V54><H4>  
54</H4></TD><TD><P>When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart,    
and they gnashed on him with their teeth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V55><H4>55</H4></TD><TD><P>But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up 
stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of ELOHIYM, and YAHSHUA standing on   
the right hand of EL,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V56><H4>56</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man      
standing on the right hand of EL.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V57>  
<H4>57</H4></TD><TD><P>Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their 
ears, and ran upon him with one accord,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V58><H4>58</H4></TD><TD><P>And cast him out of the city, and stoned him:   
and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was 
Saul.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V59><H4>59</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
they stoned Stephen, calling, and saying, ADONAY YAHSHUA, receive my spirit.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V60><H4>60</H4></TD><TD><P>And he kneeled  
down, and cried with a loud voice, YHVH, lay not this sin to their charge. And  
when he had said this, he fell asleep.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software
