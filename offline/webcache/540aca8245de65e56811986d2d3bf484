<TD><P>Hear ye this word which I take up against you, even a lamentation, O     
house of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is forsaken upon 
her land; there is none to raise her up.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>For thus saith the ADONAY YHVH; The city that     
went out by a thousand shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth by an  
hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>For thus saith YHVH unto the house  
of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and   
pass not to Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel    
shall come to nought.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Seek YHVH, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house   
of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in Bethel.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye who turn judgment   
to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Seek him that maketh the seven      
stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh   
the day dark with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth    
them out upon the face of the earth: YHVH is his name:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>That strengtheneth the spoiled      
against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>They hate him   
that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Forasmuch therefore  
as your treading is upon the poor, and ye take from him burdens of wheat: ye    
have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have        
planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>For I know your manifold  
transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe,  
and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore the prudent shall keep  
silence in that time; for it is an evil time.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live:   
and so YHVH, the ELOHIYM of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Hate the evil,

ELOHIYM of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore YHVH, the ELOHIYM   
of hosts, the ADONAY, saith thus; Wailing shall be in all streets; and they     
shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman   
to mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing.</P></TD></TR>

day of YHVH! to what end is it for you? the day of YHVH is darkness, and not    
light.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>As if

<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Though ye offer me burnt      
offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I

<A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Take thou away from me the noise of thy      
songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>

offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?</P></TD></TR><TR>

tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye 
made to yourselves.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD>

YHVH, whose name is The ELOHIYM of hosts.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This
