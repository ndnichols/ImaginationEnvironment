1</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth       
month, in the first day of the month, that the word of YHVH came unto me,       
saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Son of 
man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou    
art like a young lion of the nations, and thou art as a whale in the seas: and  
thou camest forth with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and 
fouledst their rivers.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH; I will therefore spread out my net over 
thee with a company of many people; and they shall bring thee up in my net.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Then will I leave 
thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause  
all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of  
the whole earth with thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys   
with thy height.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest, even to the 
mountains; and the rivers shall be full of thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And when I shall put thee out, I    
will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun    
with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>All the bright lights of heaven     
will I make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the ADONAY    
YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>I will   
also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring thy destruction among    
the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Yea, I will make many people      
amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall 
brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every    
man for his own life, in the day of thy fall.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>For thus saith the ADONAY YHVH; The sword of 
the king of Babylon shall come upon thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy    
multitude to fall, the terrible of the nations, all of them: and they shall     
spoil the pomp of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>I will destroy  
also all the beasts thereof from beside the great waters; neither shall the     
foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Then will I     
make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the       
ADONAY YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>
When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the country shall be          
destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all them that dwell   
therein, then shall they know that I am YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>This is the lamentation wherewith they shall 
lament her: the daughters of the nations shall lament her: they shall lament    
for her, even for Egypt, and for all her multitude, saith the ADONAY YHVH.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>It came to pass
