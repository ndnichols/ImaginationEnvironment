<p>1. WERE not in sooth, the Gods aforetime blameless, whose pleasure was increased by adoration?<br> For V&#257;yu and for man in his affliction they caused the Morning to arise with S&#363;rya.<br> 2 Guardians infallible, eager as envoys' preserve us safe through many months and autumns.<br> Addressed to you, our fair praise, Indra-V&#257;yu, implores your favour and renewed well-being.<br> 3 Wise, bright, arranger of his teams, he. seeketh men with rich food whose treasures are abundant.<br> They have arranged them of one mind with V&#257;yu: the men have wrought all noble operations.<br> 4 So far as native power and strength permit you, so far as men behold whose eyes have vision,<br> O ye pure-drinkers, drink with us pure Soma: sit on this sacred grass, Indra and V&#257;yu.<br> 5 Driving down teams that bear the lovely Heroes, hitherward, Indra-V&#257;yu, come together.<br> To you this prime of savoury juice is offered: here loose your horses and be friendly-minded.<br> 6 Your hundred and your thousand teams, O Indra and V&#257;yu, all-munificent, which attend you,<br> With these most gracious-minded come ye hither, and drink, O Heroes of the meath we offer.<br> 7 Like coursers seeking fame will we Vasisthas, O Indra-V&#257;yu, with our fair laudations,<br> Exerting all our powe-,, call you to aid us. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
