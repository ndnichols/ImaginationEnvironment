<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE KING'S GIFT</H1>
<P>SENIYA BIMBISARA, the king, having taken his refuge in the Buddha, invited the Tathagata to his palace, saying: "Will the Blessed One consent to take his meal with me tomorrow together with the fraternity of bhikkhus?" The next morning the king announced to the Blessed One that it was time for taking food: "Thou art my most welcome guest, O Lord of the world, come; the meal is prepared."</P>
<P>The Blessed One having donned his robes, took his alms-bowl and, together with a great number of bhikkhus, entered the city of Rajagaha. Sakka, the king of the Devas, assuming the appearance of a young Brahman, walked in front, and said: "He who teaches self-control with those who have learned self-control; the redeemer with those whom he has redeemed; the Blessed One with those to whom he has given peace, is entering Rajagaha Hail to the Buddha, our Lord! Honor to his name and blessings to all who take refuge in him." Sakka intoned this stanza:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Blessed is the place in which the Buddha walks,<BR>
And blessed the ears which hear his talks;<BR>
Blessed his disciples, for they are<BR>
The tellers of his truth both near and far.<BR>
"If all could hear this truth so good<BR>
Then all men's minds would eat rich food,<BR>
And strong would grow men's brotherhood."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>When the Blessed One had finished his meal, and had cleansed his bowl and his hands, the king sat down near him and thought:</P>
<P>"Where may I find a place for the Blessed One to live in, not too far from the town and not too near, suitable for going and coming, easily accessible to all people who want to see him, a place that is by day not too crowded and by night not exposed to noise, wholesome and well fitted for a retired life? There is my pleasure-garden, the bamboo grove Veluvana, fulfilling all these conditions. I shall offer it to the brotherhood whose head is the Buddha."</P>
<P>The king dedicated his garden to the brotherhood, saying: "May the Blessed One accept my gift." Then the Blessed One, having silently shown his consent and having gladdened and edified the Magadha king by religious discourse, rose from his seat and went away.</P>
