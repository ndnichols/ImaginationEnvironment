<p>1. LET us recite the praise of Dadhikr&#257;van: may all the Mornings move me to exertion;<br> Praise of the Lord of Waters, Dawn, and Agni, B&#7771;haspati Son of A&#7749;giras, and S&#363;rya.<br> 2 Brave, seeking war and booty, dwelling with the good and with the swift, may he hasten the food of Dawn.<br> May he the true, the fleet, the lover of the course, the bird-like Dadhikr&#257;van, bring food, strength, and light.<br> 3 His pinion, rapid runner, fans him m his way, as of a bird that hastens onward to its aim,<br> And, as it were a falcon's gliding through the air, strikes Dadhikr&#257;van's side as he speeds on with might.<br> 4 Bound by the neck and by the flanks and by the mouth, the vigorous Courser lends new swiftness to his speed.<br> Drawing himself together, as his strength allows, Dadhikr&#257;s springs along the windings of the paths.<br> 5 The Ha&#7745;sa homed in light, the Vasu in mid-air, the priest beside the altar, in the house the guest,<br> Dweller in noblest place, mid men, in truth, in sky, born of flood, kine, truth, mountain, he is holy Law.</p>
