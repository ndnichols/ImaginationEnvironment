1</H4></TD><TD><P>Also, thou son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, 
and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of YHVH:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH; Because 
the enemy hath said against you, Aha, even the ancient high places are ours in  
possession:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH; Because they have made  
you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that ye might be a possession 
unto the residue of the heathen, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers,    
and are an infamy of the people:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>
4</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the       
ADONAY YHVH; Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH to the mountains, and to the hills, to  
the rivers, and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes, and to the cities that  
are forsaken, which became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen    
that are round about;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Therefore thus saith the ADONAY YHVH; Surely in the fire of my jealousy  
have I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and against all Idumea, which 
have appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all their heart,   
with despiteful minds, to cast it out for a prey.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Prophesy therefore concerning the   
land of Israel, and say unto the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers,    
and to the valleys, Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH; Behold, I have spoken in my     
jealousy and in my fury, because ye have borne the shame of the heathen:</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore thus    
saith the ADONAY YHVH; I have lifted up mine hand, Surely the heathen that are  
about you, they shall bear their shame.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot     
forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for they are  
at hand to come.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall be tilled  
and sown:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, even all of it: and  
the cities shall be inhabited, and the wastes shall be builded:</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will multiply upon  
you man and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit: and I will settle   
you after your old estates, and will do better unto you than at your            
beginnings: and ye shall know that I am YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even 
my people Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their          
inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus saith the       
ADONAY YHVH; Because they say unto you, Thou land devourest up men, and hast    
bereaved thy nations:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>Therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy        
nations any more, saith the ADONAY YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the    
shame of the heathen any more, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the      
people any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more, saith   
the ADONAY YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Moreover the word of YHVH came unto me, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Son of man, when the house of     
Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their own way and by their   
doings: their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore I poured   
my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for their 
idols wherewith they had polluted it:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And I scattered them among the heathen, and     
they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according 
to their doings I judged them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4> 
20</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went,   
they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are the people of     
YHVH, and are gone forth out of his land.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>But I had pity for mine holy name, which the    
house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, whither they went.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore say unto the    
house of Israel, thus saith the ADONAY YHVH; I do not this for your sakes, O    
house of Israel, but for mine holy name's sake, which ye have profaned among    
the heathen, whither ye went.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>  
23</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among  
the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall 
know that I am YHVH, saith the ADONAY YHVH, when I shall be sanctified in you   
before their eyes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all    
countries, and will bring you into your own land.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Then will I sprinkle clean water  
upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your    
idols, will I cleanse you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>     
26</H4></TD><TD><P>A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I    
put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I   
will give you an heart of flesh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27>   
<H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to    
walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And ye shall dwell in the 
land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your 
ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>I   
will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the corn,   
and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will multiply the fruit of  
the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach 
of famine among the heathen.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>   
31</H4></TD><TD><P>Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings   
that were not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your       
iniquities and for your abominations.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>Not for your sakes do I this, saith the ADONAY  
YHVH, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O      
house of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH; In the day that I shall have cleansed you    
from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities, and the  
wastes shall be builded.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in   
the sight of all that passed by.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35>   
<H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And they shall say, This land that was desolate is       
become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities    
are become fenced, and are inhabited.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the heathen that are left round about you  
shall know that I YHVH build the ruined places, and plant that that was         
desolate: I YHVH have spoken it, and I will do it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH; I     
will yet for this be enquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them; I   
will increase them with men like a flock.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in 
her solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and  
they shall know that I am YHVH.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
