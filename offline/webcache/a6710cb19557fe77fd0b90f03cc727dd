<p>1. WHETHER of these is elder, whether later? How were they born? Who knoweth it, ye sages?<br> These of themselves support all things existing: as on a car the Day and Night roll onward.<br> 2 The Twain uphold, though motionless and footless, a widespread offspring having feet and moving.<br> Like your own son upon his parents&#146; bosom, protect us, Heaven and earth, from fearful danger.<br> 3 I call for Aditi's unrivalled bounty, perfect, celestial, deathless, meet for worship.<br> Produce this, ye Twain Worlds, for him who lauds you. Protect us, Heaven and Earth, from fearful danger.<br> 4 May we be close to both the Worlds who suffer no pain, Parents of Gods, who aid with favour,<br> Both mid the Gods, with Day and Night alternate. Protect us, Heaven and Earth, from fearful danger.<br> 5 Faring together, young, with meeting limits, Twin Sisters lying in their Parents&#146; bosom,<br> Kissing the centre of the world together. Protect us, Heaven and Earth, from fearful danger.<br> 6 Duly I call the two wide seats, the mighty, the general Parents, with the God's protection.<br> Who, beautiful to look on, make the nectar. Protect us, Heaven and Earth, from fearful danger.<br> 7 Wide, vast, and manifold, whose bounds are distant,&#151;these, reverent, I address at this our worship,<br> The blessed Pair, victorious, all-sustaining. Protect us, Heaven and Earth, from fearful danger.<br> 8 What sin we have at any time committed against the Gods, our friend, our house's chieftain,<br> Thereof may this our hymn be expiation. Protect us, Heaven and Earth, from fearful danger.<br> 9 May both these Friends of man, who bless, preserve me, may they attend me with their help and favour.<br> Enrich the man more liberal than the godless. May we, ye Gods, be strong with food rejoicing.<br> 10 Endowed with understanding, I have uttered this truth, for all to hear, to Earth and Heaven.<br> Be near us, keep us from reproach and trouble. Father and Mother, with your help preserve us.<br> 11 Be this my prayer fulfilled, O Earth and Heaven, wherewith, Father and Mother, I address you.<br> Nearest of Gods be ye with your protection. May we find strengthening food in full abundance.</p>
