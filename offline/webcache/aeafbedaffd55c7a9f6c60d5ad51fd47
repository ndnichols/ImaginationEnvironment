<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>The word that came to Jeremiah  
from YHVH in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth 
year of Nebuchadrezzar.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>For then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem: and         
Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which was in the   
king of Judah's house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost  
thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith YHVH, Behold, I will give this city into the 
hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And Zedekiah king of Judah shall    
not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into 
the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and   
his eyes shall behold his eyes;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4> 
5</H4></TD><TD><P>And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be  
until I visit him, saith YHVH: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not 
prosper.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
Jeremiah said, The word of YHVH came unto me, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum 
thine uncle shall come unto thee saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth: 
for the right of redemption is thine to buy it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>So Hanameel mine uncle's son came to me in the 
court of the prison according to the word of YHVH, and said unto me, Buy my     
field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin:   
for the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for  
thyself. Then I knew that this was the word of YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And I bought the field of Hanameel  
my uncle's son, that was in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen 
shekels of silver.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and    
weighed him the money in the balances.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>So I took the evidence of the purchase, both    
that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and that which was       
open:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And I  
gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of     
Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle's son, and in the presence of the 
witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that    
sat in the court of the prison.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>
13</H4></TD><TD><P>And I charged Baruch before them, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus saith YHVH of hosts, the 
ELOHIYM of Israel; Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both    
which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen    
vessel, that they may continue many days.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>For thus saith YHVH of hosts, the ELOHIYM of    
Israel; Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this        
land.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Now    
when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of        
Neriah, I prayed unto YHVH, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17>
<H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Ah ADONAY YHVH! behold, thou hast made the heaven and    
the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too    
hard for thee:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of 
the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: the Great, the Mighty  
ELOHIYM, YHVH of hosts, is his name,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine 
eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men: to give every one according 
to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Which hast set signs and wonders  
in the land of Egypt, even unto this day, and in Israel, and among other men;   
and hast made thee a name, as at this day;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And hast brought forth thy people Israel out of 
the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and     
with a stretched out arm, and with great terror;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And hast given them this land,    
which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk  
and honey;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither      
walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to  
do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them:</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Behold the mounts, they   
are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the   
Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and  
of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou 
seest it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And thou hast said unto me, O ADONAY YHVH, Buy thee the field for money, and    
take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>Then came the word   
of YHVH unto Jeremiah, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4> 
27</H4></TD><TD><P>Behold, I am YHVH, the ELOHIYM of all flesh: is there any    
thing too hard for me?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>Therefore thus saith YHVH; Behold, I will give this city into the   
hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and 
he shall take it:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire 
on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered   
incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke   
me to anger.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>
For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before 
me from their youth: for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger  
with the work of their hands, saith YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>For this city hath been to me as a provocation  
of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this     
day; that I should remove it from before my face,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>Because of all the evil of the    
children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to        
provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their 
prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And they have turned unto 
me the back, and not the face: though I taught them, rising up early and        
teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>But they set their        
abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And they built the   
high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause     
their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I    
commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this      
abomination, to cause Judah to sin.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36>
<H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>And now therefore thus saith YHVH, the ELOHIYM of        
Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into the    
hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the         
pestilence;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have driven them in  
mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again     
unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>And they shall be my people, and  
I will be their ELOHIYM:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me  
for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will make an        
everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them 
good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from   
me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>Yea, I   
will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land      
assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>For thus saith YHVH; Like as I    
have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them    
all the good that I have promised them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>And fields shall be bought in this land,        
whereof ye say, It is desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand  
of the Chaldeans.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal them,  
and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem,  
and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the      
cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south: for I will cause their    
captivity to return, saith YHVH.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
