1</H4></TD><TD><P>Then spake YAHSHUA to the multitude, and to his disciples,</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Saying The        
scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, 
that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do      
not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>For they  
bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders;   
but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>But all their works they do 
for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the      
borders of their garments,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the  
synagogues,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>But be not ye called   
Rabbi: for one is your Master, even MASHIYACH; and all ye are brethren.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And call no man your   
father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Neither be ye called      
masters: for one is your Master, even MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>But he that is greatest among you 
shall be your servant.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that      
shall humble himself shall be exalted.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees,        
hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go 
in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Woe unto you, scribes and 
Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make    
long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Woe unto you, scribes and     
Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and   
when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Woe unto you,   
ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; 
but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye fools and blind:  
for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And, Whosoever  
shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the gift     
that is upon it, he is guilty.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4> 
19</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the 
altar that sanctifieth the gift?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20>   
<H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by    
it, and by all things thereon.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4> 
21</H4></TD><TD><P>And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by  
him that dwelleth therein.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>     
22</H4></TD><TD><P>And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of 
ELOHIYM, and by him that sitteth thereon.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees,            
hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the 
weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to     
have done, and not to leave the other undone.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and 
swallow a camel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the   
outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion    
and excess.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter,    
that the outside of them may be clean also.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees,            
hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear         
beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all          
uncleanness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>
Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of  
hypocrisy and iniquity.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build   
the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And say, If we had   
been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in  
the blood of the prophets.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>

children of them which killed the prophets.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore, behold, I send     
unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill    
and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and          
persecute them from city to city:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35>  
<H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon 
the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of  
Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>Verily I say unto you, All these  
things shall come upon this generation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have     
gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her  
wings, and ye would not!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4>

YHVH.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M. Hurt,
