<p>1. YEA, specially that mortal man hath toiled for service of the Gods,<br> Who quickly hath brought near Mitra and Varu&#7751;a. to share his sacrificial gifts.<br> 2 Supreme in sovran power, far-sighted, Chiefs and Kings, most swift to hear from far away,<br> Both, wondrously, set them in motion as with arms, in company with S&#363;rya's beams.<br> 3 The rapid messenger who runs before you, Mitra-Varu&#7751;a, with iron head, swift to the draught,<br> 4 He whom no man may question, none may summon back, who stands not still for colloquy,&#151;<br> From hostile clash with him keep ye us safe this day: keep us in safety with your arms.<br> 5 To Aryaman and Mitra sing a reverent song, O pious one,<br> A pleasant hymn that shall protect to Varu&#7751;a: sing forth a laud unto the Kings.<br> 6 The true, Red Treasure they have sent, one only Son born of the Three.<br> They, the Immortal Ones, never deceived, survey the families of mortal men.<br> 7 My songs are lifted up, and acts most splendid are to be performed.<br> Come hither, ye N&#257;satyas, with accordant mind, to meet and to enjoy my gifts.<br> 8 Lords of great wealth, when we invoke your bounty which no demon checks,<br> Both of you, furthering our eastward-offcred praise, come, Chiefs whom Jamadagni lauds!<br> 9 Come, V&#257;yu, drawn by fair hymns, to our sacrifice that reaches heaven.<br> Poured on the middle of the strainingcloth, and cooked, this bright drink hath been offered ilice.<br> 10 He comes by straightest paths, as ministering Priest, to taste the sacrificial gifts.<br> Then, Lord of harnessed teams I drink of the twofold draught, bright Soma mingled with the milk.<br> 11 Verily, S&#363;rya, thou art great; truly, &#256;ditya, thou art great.<br> As thou art great indeed, thy greatness is admired: yea, verily, thou, God, art great.<br> 12 Yea, S&#363;rya, thou art great in fame thou evermore, O God, art great.<br> Thou by thy greatness art the Gods&#146; High Priest, divine, far-spread unconquerable light.<br> 13 She yonder, bending lowly down, clothed in red hues and rich in rays,<br> Is seen, advancing as it were with various tints, amid the ten surrounding arms.<br> 14 Past and gone are three mortal generations: the fourth and last into the Sun hath entered.<br> He mid the worlds his lofty place hath taken. Into green plants is gone the Purifying.<br> 15 The Rudras' Mother, Daughter of the Vasus, centre of nectar, the &#256;dityas&#146; Sister-<br> To folk who understand will 1 proclaim it-injure not Aditi, the Cow, the sinless.<br> 16 Weak-minded men have as a cow adopted me who came hither from the Gods, a Goddess,<br> Who, skilled in eloquence, her voice uplifteth, who standeth near at hand with all devotions.</p>
