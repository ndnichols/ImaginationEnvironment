foreknowledge of ELOHIYM the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto 
obedience and sprinkling of the blood of YAHSHUA MASHIYACH: Grace unto you, and 
peace, be multiplied.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Blessed be the ELOHIYM and Father of our ADONAY YAHSHUA MASHIYACH, which

the resurrection of YAHSHUA MASHIYACH from the dead,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness    
through manifold temptations:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>   
7</H4></TD><TD><P>That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than   
of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto       
praise and honour and glory at the appearing of YAHSHUA MASHIYACH:</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Whom having not seen, ye

was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the       
things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel   
unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels     
desire to look into.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4>

MASHIYACH;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>  
As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts   
in your ignorance:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of  
conversation;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD>

<H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with      
corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by 
tradition from your fathers;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>

without blemish and without spot:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20>  
<H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the

heart fervently:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD>

all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the       
flower thereof falleth away:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>

the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
