<TD><P>Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and    
authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And he sent them to preach the      
kingdom of EL, and to heal the sick.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3>
<H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey,     
neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats 
apiece.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And whosoever will not      
receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your     
feet for a testimony against them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6>  
<H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching  
the gospel, and healing every where.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7>
<H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: 
and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen     
from the dead;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>
And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the old        
prophets was risen again.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I    
hear such things? And he desired to see him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And the apostles, when they were returned, told 
him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a   
desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And the people, when they knew    
it, followed him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of   
EL, and healed them that had need of healing.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the day began to wear away, then    
came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go   
into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are 
here in a desert place.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have  
no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for    
all this people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples,     
Make them sit down by fifties in a company.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And they did so, and made them all sit down.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Then he took    
the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them,  
and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And they did eat, and     
were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them      
twelve baskets.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him:   
and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>They answering said, John the     
Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others say, that one of the old prophets is   
risen again.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>
He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The         
MASHIYACH of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man     
that thing;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders   
and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said to  
them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his  
cross daily, and follow me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>    
24</H4></TD><TD><P>For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but          
whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>For what is a man         
advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>For whosoever   
shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, 
when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy       
angels.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>But  
I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of    
death, till they see the kingdom of EL.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass about an eight days after   
these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to 
pray.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And as 
he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was      
white and glistering.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and    
Elias:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>Who   
appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at       
Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>  
But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were 
awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, as   
they departed from him, Peter said unto YAHSHUA, Master, it is good for us to   
be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses,    
and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and    
overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And there came a voice    
out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the voice was past,  
YAHSHUA was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days  
any of those things which they had seen.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, that on the next day, when 
they were come down from the hill, much people met him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>And, behold, a man of the company 
cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine     
only child.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him    
that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>And I besought thy        
disciples to cast him out; and they could not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA answering said, O faithless and  
perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy    
son hither.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him. And YAHSHUA 
rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to    
his father.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And they were all amazed at the mighty power of ELOHIYM. But while they         
wondered every one at all things which YAHSHUA did, he said unto his            
disciples,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be         
delivered into the hands of men.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45>   
<H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P>But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from 
them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46><H4>46</H4></TD><TD><P>Then there      
arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>47</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA, perceiving   
the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V48><H4>48</H4></TD><TD><P>And said unto them, Whosoever 
shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive   
me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same     
shall be great.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V49><H4>49</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy     
name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V50><H4>50</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA said unto him, Forbid 
him not: for he that is not against us is for us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V51><H4>51</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, when the     
time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go   
to Jerusalem,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V52><H4>52</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a       
village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V53><H4>53</H4></TD><TD><P>And they did not receive him,     
because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V54><H4>54</H4></TD><TD><P>And when his disciples James and  
John saw this, they said, ADONAY, wilt thou that we command fire to come down   
from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V55><H4>55</H4></TD><TD><P>But he turned, and rebuked them,  
and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V56><H4>56</H4></TD><TD><P>For the Son of man is not come to 
destroy men's lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V57><H4>57</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to  
pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, ADONAY, I     
will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V58><H4>58</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA said unto him, Foxes have holes,    
and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his   
head.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V59><H4>59</H4></TD><TD><P>And he 
said unto another, Follow me. But he said, ADONAY, suffer me first to go and    
bury my father.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V60><H4>60</H4></TD><TD>
<P>YAHSHUA said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach  
the kingdom of EL.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V61><H4>61</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And another also said, ADONAY, I will follow thee; but let me first go   
bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V62><H4>62</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA said unto him, No     
man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the        
kingdom of EL.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John
