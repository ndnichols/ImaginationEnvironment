<TD><P>And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of   
Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into    
the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more  
in any coast of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD
