<p>1. To Indra from the heart the hymn proceedeth, to him the Lord, recited, built with praises;<br> The wakening song sung forth in holy synod: that which is born for thee, O Indra, notice.<br> 2 Born from the heaven e&#146;en in the days aforetime, wakening, sting aloud in holy synod,<br> Auspicious, clad in white and shining raiment, this is the ancient hymn of our forefathers.<br> 3 The Mother of the Twins hath borne Twin Children: my tongue's tip raised itself and rested silent.<br> Killing the darkness at the light's foundation, the Couple newly born attain their beauty.<br> 4 Not one is found among them, none of mortals, to blame our sires who fought to win the cattle.<br> Their strengthener was Indra the Majestic he spread their stalls of kine the Wonder-Worker.<br> 5 Where as a Friend with friendly men, Navagvas, with heroes, on his knees he sought the cattle.<br> There, verily with ten Da&#347;agvas Indra found the Sun lying hidden in the darkness.<br> 6 Indra found meath collected in the milch-cow, by foot and hoof, in the cow's place of pasture.<br> That which lay secret, hidden in the waters, he held in his right hand, the rich rewarder.<br> 7 He took the light, discerning it from darkness: may we be far removed from all misfortune.<br> These songs, O Soma-drinker, cheered by Soma, Indra, accept from thy most zealous poet.<br> 8 Let there be light through both the worlds for worship: may we be far from most overwhelming evil.<br> Great woe comes even from the hostile mortal, piled up; but good at rescue are the Vasus.<br> 9 Call we on Maghavan, auspicious Indra, best Hero in the fight where spoil is gathered,<br> The Strong, who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the V&#7771;tras, wins and gathers riches.</p>
