<TD><P>These words spake YAHSHUA, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said,   
Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify        
thee:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>As thou  
hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as     
many as thou hast given him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>    
3</H4></TD><TD><P>And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only  
true ELOHIYM, and YAHSHUA MASHIYACH, whom thou hast sent.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>I have glorified thee on the earth: 
I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And now, O Father, glorify thou me  
with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world       
was.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>I have    
manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine   
they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Now they have known that    
all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>For I have given unto them the      
words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely  
that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>I pray for them:  
I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are   
thine.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.</P></TD>

through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as  
we are.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>     
While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou    
gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that 
the scripture might be fulfilled.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13>  
<H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the  
world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>I have given them thy word;   
and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am  
not of the world.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD>

shouldest keep them from the evil.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16>
