</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>But I determined  
this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>For if I make you sorry,    
who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And I wrote this  
same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I      
ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you   
all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>For out   
of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not   
that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more    
abundantly unto you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that  
I may not overcharge you all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>

inflicted of many.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him,    
lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore I beseech    
you that ye would confirm your love toward him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>For to this end also did I write, that I might 
know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>To whom ye forgive any thing, 
I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your      
sakes forgave I it in the person of MASHIYACH;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Lest Satan should get an advantage of us:    
for we are not ignorant of his devices.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach     
MASHIYACH's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the ADONAY,</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>I had no rest in my       
spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I    
went from thence into Macedonia.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14>   
<H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Now thanks be unto EL, which always causeth us to        
triumph in MASHIYACH, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in  
every place.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>
For we are unto EL a sweet savour of MASHIYACH, in them that are saved, and in  
them that perish:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the   
savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>For we are not as many,   
which corrupt the word of ELOHIYM: but as of sincerity, but as of EL, in the    
sight of EL speak we in MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
