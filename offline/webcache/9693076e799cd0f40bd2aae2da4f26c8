<p>1. IN all the worlds That was the Best and Highest whence sprang the Mighty Gods, of splendid valour.<br> As soon as born he overcomes his foemen, be in whom all who lend him aid are joyful.<br> 2 Grown mighty in his strength, with ample vigour, he as a foe strikes fear into the D&#257;sa,<br> Eager to win the breathing and the breathless. All sang thy praise at banquet and oblation.<br> 3 All concentrate on thee their mental vigour, what time these, twice or thrice, are thine assistants.<br> Blend what is sweeter than the sweet with sweetness: win. quickly with our meath that meath in battle.<br> 4 Therefore in thee too, thou who winnest riches, at every banquet are the sages joyful.<br> With mightier power, Bold God, extend thy firmness: let not malignant Y&#257;tudh&#257;nas harm thee.<br> 5 Proudly we put our trust in thee in battles, when we behold great wealth the prize of combat.<br> I with my words impel thy weapons onward, and sharpen with my prayer thy vital vigour.<br> 6 Worthy of praises, many-shaped, most skilful, most energetic, &#256;ptya of the Aptyas:<br> He with his might destroys the seven Danus, subduing many who were deemed his equals.<br> 7 Thou in that house which thy protection guardeth bestowest wealth, the higher and the lower.<br> Thou stablishest the two much-wandering Mothers, and bringest many deeds to their completion.<br> 8 Brhaddiva, the foremost of light-winners, repeats these holy prayers, this strength of Indra.<br> He rules the great self-luminous fold of cattle, and all the doors of light hath he thrown open.<br> 9 Thus hath Brhaddiva, the great Atharvan, spoken to Indra as himself in person.<br> The spotless Sisters, they who are his Mothers, with power exalt him and impel him onward.</p>
