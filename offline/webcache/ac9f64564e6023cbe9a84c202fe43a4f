<p>1. LET our strong hymn of praise go forth, the laud of Mitra-Varu&#7751;a,<br> With homage to that high-born Pair;<br> 2 The Two exceeding wise, the Sons of Dak&#7779;a, whom the gods ordained<br> For lordship, excellently great.<br> 3 Such, Guardians of our homes and us, O Mitra-Varu&#7751;a, fulfil<br> The thoughts of those who sing your praise.<br> 4 So when the Sun hath risen to-day, may sinless Mitra, Aryaman,<br> Bhaga, and Savitar sendus forth.<br> 5 May this our home be guarded well forward, ye Bounteous, on the way,<br> Who bear us safely o&#146;er distress.<br> 6. And those Self-reigning, Aditi, whose statute is inviolate,<br> The Kings who rule a vast domain.<br> 7 Soon as the Sun hath risen, to you, to Mitra-Varu&#7751;a, I sing,<br> And Aryarnan who slays the foe.<br> 8 With wealth of gold may this my song bring unmolested power and might,<br> And, Brahmans, gain the sacrifice.<br> 9 May we be thine, God Varu&#7751;a, and with our princes, Mitra, thine.<br> Food and Heaven's light will we obtain.<br> 10 Many are they who strengthen Law, Sun-eyed, with Agni for their tongue,<br> They who direct the three great gatherings with their thoughts, yea, all things with surpassing might.<br> 11 They who have stablished year and month and then the day, night, sacrifice and holy verse,<br> Varu&#7751;a, Mitra, Aryarnan, the Kings, have won dominion which none else may gain.<br> 12 So at the rising of the Sun we think of you with hymns to-day,<br> Even as Varu&#7751;a, Mitra, Aryaman deserve: ye are the charioteers of Law.<br> 13 True to Law, born in Law the strengtheners of Law, terrible, haters of the false,<br> In their felicity which gives the best defence may we men and our princes dwell.<br> 14 Uprises, on the slope of heaven, that marvel that attracts die sight<br> As swift celestial Eta&#347;a bears it away, prepared for every eye to see.<br> 15 Lord of each single head, of fixt and moving things, equally through the whole expanse,<br> The Seven sister Bays bear S&#363;rya on his car, to bring us wealth and happiness.<br> 16 A hundred autumns may we see that bright Eye, God-ordained, arise<br> A hundred autumns may we live.<br> 17 Infallible through your wisdom, come hither, resplendent Varu&#7751;a,<br> And Mitra, to the Soma draught.<br> 18 Come as the laws of Heaven ordain, Varu&#7751;a, Mitra, void of guile:<br> Press near and drink the Soma juice.<br> 19 Come, Mitra, Varu&#7751;a, accept, Heroes, our sacrificial gift:<br> Drink Soma, ye who strengthen Law.</p>
