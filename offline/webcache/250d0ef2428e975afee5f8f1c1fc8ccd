in low place.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P> 
I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the      
earth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>He that 
diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall  
bite him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>     
Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood shall  
be endangered thereby.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put 
to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Surely the serpent will bite

who can tell him?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth

drunkenness!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>
