<p>1. AGNI, the bright face of the Dawns, is shining; the singers' pious voices have ascended.<br> Borne on your chariot, A&#347;vins, turn you hither and come unto our full and rich libation.<br> 2 Most frequent guests, they scorn not what is ready: even now the lauded A&#347;vins are beside us.<br> With promptest aid they come at morn and evening, the worshipper's most blessed guards from trouble.<br> 3 Yea, come at milking-time, at early morning, at noon of day and when the Sun is setting,<br> By day, by night, with favour most auspicious. Not only now the draught hath drawn the A&#347;vins.<br> 4 For this place, A&#347;vins, was of old your dwelling, these were your houses, this your habitation.<br> Come to us from high heaven and from the mountain. Come from the waters bringing food and vigour.<br> 5 May we obtain the A&#347;vins' newest favour, and gain their health-bestowing happy guidance.<br> Bring riches hither unto us, and heroes, and all felicity and joy, Immortals!</p>
