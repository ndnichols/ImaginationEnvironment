<p>1. A THOUSAND are thy helps for us, O Indra: a thousand, Lord of Bays, thy choice refreshments.<br> Wealth of a thousand sorts hast thou to cheer us: may precious goods come nigh to us in thousands.<br> 2 May the most sapient Maruts, with protection, with best boons brought from lofty heaven, approach us,<br> Now when their team of the most noble horses speeds even on the sea's extremest limit.<br> 3 Close to them clings one moving in seclusion, like a man's wife, like a spear carried rearward,<br> Well grasped, bright, decked with gold there is V&#257;k also, like to a courtly, eloquent dame, among them.<br> 4 Far off the brilliant, never-weary Maruts cling to the young Maid as a joint possession.<br> The fierce Gods drave not Rodas&#299; before them, but wished for her to grow their friend and fellow.<br> 5 When chose immortal Rodas&#299; to follow&#151;she with loose tresses and heroic spirit&#151;<br> She climbed her servant's chariot, she like S&#363;rya with cloud-like motion and refulgent aspect.<br> 6 Upon their car the young men set the Maiden wedded to glory, mighty in assemblies,<br> When your song, Maruts, rose, and, with oblation, the Soma-pourer sang his hymn in worship.<br> 7 I will declare the greatness of these Maruts, their real greatness, worthy to be lauded,<br> How, with them, she though firm, strong-minded, haughty, travels to women happy in their fortune.<br> 8 Mitra and Varu&#7751;a they guard from censure: Aryaman too, discovers worthless sinners Firm things are overthrown that ne&#146;er were shaken: he prospers, Maruts, who gives choice oblations.<br> 9 None of us, Maruts, near or at a distance, hath ever reached the limit of your vigour.<br> They in courageous might still waxing boldly have compassed round their foemen like an ocean.<br> 10 May we this day be dearest friends of Indra, and let us call on him in fight to-morrow.<br> So were we erst. New might attend us daily! So be with us! &#7770;bhuk&#7779;an of the Heroes!<br> 11 May this your laud, may this your song, O Maruts, sung by the poet, M&#257;na's son, M&#257;nd&#257;rya,<br> Bring offspring for ourselves with. food to feed us. May we find strengthening food in full abundance.</p>
