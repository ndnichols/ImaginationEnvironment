of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear by the    
name of YHVH, and make mention of the ELOHIYM of Israel, but not in truth, nor  
in righteousness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD>
<P>For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the      
ELOHIYM of Israel; YHVH of hosts is his name.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>I have declared the former things from the     
beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did them   
suddenly, and they came to pass.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>
4</H4></TD><TD><P>Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an    
iron sinew, and thy brow brass;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4> 
5</H4></TD><TD><P>I have even from the beginning declared it to thee; before it 
came to pass I shewed it thee: lest thou shouldest say, Mine idol hath done     
them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou hast heard, see   
all this; and will not ye declare it? I have shewed thee new things from this   
time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>They are created now, and not from  
the beginning; even before the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou       
shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8> 
<H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from  
that time that thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal     
very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>For my name's sake will I   
defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee    
not off.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee in the     
furnace of affliction.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for how    
should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory unto another.</P></TD>

Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.</P>

prosperous.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from the
