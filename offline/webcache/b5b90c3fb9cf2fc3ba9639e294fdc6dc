1</H4></TD><TD><P>Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the     
law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>For the woman which    
hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if 
the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>So then if, while her       
husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an           
adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she  
is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are 
become dead to the law by the body of MASHIYACH; that ye should be married to   
another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth    
fruit unto ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the    
law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>But now we are delivered from   
the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness  
of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>What shall we say then? Is the law  
sin? Forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known      
lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>But sin, taking occasion by the     
commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin 
was dead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>For  
I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived,   
and I died.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>For sin, taking 
occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore the law is holy,    
and the commandment holy, and just, and good.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Was then that which is good made death unto  
me? Forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that      
which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>For we know     
that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>For that which I do I allow   
not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>If then I do that which I 
would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Now then it is no more I that do  
it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18>   
<H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth   
no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is 
good I find not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that 
I do.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Now if 
I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in     
me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>I find   
then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>For I delight in the law  
of ELOHIYM after the inward man:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23>   
<H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>But I see another law in my members, warring against the 
law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my 
members.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>O   
wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>I thank EL      
through YAHSHUA MASHIYACH our ADONAY. So then with the mind I myself serve the  
law of ELOHIYM; but with the flesh the law of sin.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
