<p>1. THE singer, O ye Waters in Vivasv&#257;n's place, shall tell your grandeur forth that is beyond compare.<br> The Rivers have come forward triply, seven and seven. Sindhu in might surpasses all the streams that flow.<br> 2 Varu&#7751;a cut the channels for thy forward course, O Sindhu, when thou rannest on to win the race.<br> Thou speedest o&#146;er precipitous ridges of the earth, when thou art Lord and Leader of these moving floods.<br> 3 His roar is lifted up to heaven above the earth: he puts forth endless vigour with a flash of light.<br> Like floods of rain that fall in thunder from the cloud, so Sindhu rushes on bellowing like a bull.<br> 4 Like mothers to their calves, like milch kine with their milk, so, Sindhu, unto thee the roaring rivers run.<br> Thou leadest as a warrior king thine army's wings what time thou comest in the van of these swift streams.<br> 5 Favour ye this my laud, O Gan!g&#257;, Yamun&#257;, O Sutudri, Paru&#7779;&#7751;&#299; and Sarasvat&#299;:<br> With Asikni, Vitasta, O Marudvrdha, O &#256;rj&#299;k&#299;ya with Susoma hear my call.<br> 6 First with Trstama thou art eager to flow forth, with Ras&#257;, and Susartu, and with Svetya here,<br> With Kubha; and with these, Sindhu and Mehatnu, thou seekest in thy course Krumu and Gomati.<br> 7 Flashing and whitely-gleaming in her mightiness, she moves along her ample volumes through the realms,<br> Most active of the active, Sindhu unrestrained, like to a dappled mare, beautiful, fair to see.<br> 8 Rich in good steeds is Sindhu, rich in cars and robes, rich in gold, nobly-fashioned, rich in ample wealth.<br> Blest Silamavati and young Urnavati invest themselves with raiment rich in store of sweets.<br> 9 Sindhu hath yoked her car, light-rolling, drawn by steeds, and with that car shall she win booty in this fight.<br> So have I praised its power, mighty and unrestrained, of independent glory, roaring as it runs.</p>
