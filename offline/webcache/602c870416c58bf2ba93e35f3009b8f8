<p>1. HE only is the Sea, holder of treasures: born many a time he views the hearts within us.<br> He hides him in the secret couple's bosom. The Bird dwells in the middle of the fountain.<br> 2 Inhabiting one dwelling-place in common, strong Stallions and the Mares have come together.<br> The sages guard the seat of Holy Order, and keep the highest names concealed within them.<br> 3 The Holy Pair, of wondrous power, have coupled: they formed the Infant, they who bred produced him.<br> The central point of all that moves and moves not, the while they wove the Sage's thread with insight<br> 4 For tracks of Order and refreshing viands attend from ancient times the goodly Infant.<br> Wearing him as a mantle, Earth and Heaven grow strong by food of pleasant drink and fatness.<br> 5 He, calling loudly to the Seven red Sisters, hath, skilled in sweet drink, brought them to be looked on.<br> He, born of old, in middle air hath halted, and sought and found the covering robe of P&#363;&#7779;an.<br> 6 Seven are the pathways which the wise have fashioned; to one of these may come the troubled mortal.<br> He standeth in the dwelling of the Highest, a Pillar, on sure ground where paths are parted.<br> 7 Not Being, Being in the highest heaven, in Aditi's bosom and in Dak&#7779;a's birthplace,<br> Is Agni, our first-born of Holy Order, the Milch-cow and the Bull in life's beginning.</p>
