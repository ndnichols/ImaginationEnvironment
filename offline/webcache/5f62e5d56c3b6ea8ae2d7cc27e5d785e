<p>1. To him who shines afar, Vai&#347;v&#257;nara, shall bards give precious things that he may go on certain paths:<br> For Agni the Immortal serves the Deities, and therefore never breaks their everlasting laws.<br> 2 He, wondrous envoy, goes between the earth and heaven, firm seated as the Herald, great High Priest of men.<br> He compassethwith rays the lofty dwelling-place, Agni, sent forward by the Gods, enriched with piayer.<br> 3 Sages shall glorify Agni with earnest thoughts, ensign of sacrifice, who fills the synod full:<br> In whom the singers have stored up their holy acts to him the worshipper looks for joy and happiness.<br> 4 The Sire of sacrifice, great God of holy bards, Agni, the measure and the symbol of the priests,<br> Hath entered heaven and earth that show in varied form: the Sage whom many love rejoiceth in his might.<br> 5 Bright Agni with the bright car, Lord of green domains, Vai&#347;v&#257;nara dweller in the floods, who finds the light,<br> Pervading, swift and wild, encompassed round with powers, him very glorious have the Gods established here.<br> 6 Agni, together with the Gods and Manu's folk by thought extending sacrifice in varied form,<br> Goes, car-borne, to and fro with those who crown each rite, the fleet, the Household Friend, who turns the curse aside.<br> 7 Sing, Agni, for long life to us and noble sons: teem thou with plenty, shine upon us store of food.<br> Increase the great man's strength, thou ever-vigilant: thou, longing for the Gods, knowest their hymns full well.<br> 8 The Mighty One, Lord of the people and their guest, the leader of their thoughts, devoted Friend of priests,<br> Our solemn rites' announcer, J&#257;tavedas, men with worship ever praise, with urgings for their weal.<br> 9 Agni the God resplendent, giver of great joy, hath on his lovely car compassed the lands with, might.<br> Let us with pure laudations in his house approach the high laws of the nourisher of multitudes.<br> 10 I celebrate thy glories, O Vai&#347;v&#257;nara, wherewith thou, O farsighted God, has found the light.<br> Thou filledst at thy birth both worlds, the earth and heaven: all this, O Agni, hast thou compassed of thyself.<br> 11 By his great skill the Sage alone hath brought to pass a great deed, mightier than Vai&#347;v&#257;nara's wondrous acts.<br> Agni sprang into being, magnifying both his Parents, Heaven and Earth, rich in prolific seed.</p>
