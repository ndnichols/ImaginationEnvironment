And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed     
through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>He said unto      
them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto     
him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, Unto 
what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said Paul, John verily 
baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they      
should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on MASHIYACH        
YAHSHUA.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>When  
they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the ADONAY YAHSHUA.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And when Paul had laid 
his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues,  
and prophesied.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And all the men were about twelve.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly  
for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning   
the kingdom of EL.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that  
way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples,   
disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And this continued by the space of two       
years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the ADONAY        
YAHSHUA, both Jews and Greeks.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4> 
11</H4></TD><TD><P>And ELOHIYM wrought special miracles by the hands of         
Paul:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>So     
that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the  
diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Then certain of the  
vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil       
spirits the name of the ADONAY YAHSHUA, saying, We adjure you by YAHSHUA whom   
Paul preacheth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests,     
which did so.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And the evil spirit answered and said, YAHSHUA I know, and Paul I know; but  
who are ye?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and  
prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and           
wounded.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear    
fell on them all, and the name of the ADONAY YAHSHUA was magnified.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And many that        
believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Many of them also which used      
curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and  
they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of           
silver.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>So   
mightily grew the word of ELOHIYM and prevailed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>After these things were ended,    
Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia,   
to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>So he sent into 
Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he   
himself stayed in Asia for a season.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And the same time there arose no small stir     
about that way.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD>
<P>For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines  
for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Whom he called together with the  
workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have  
our wealth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all  
Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be 
no gods, which are made with hands:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27>
<H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set   
at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be        
despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world 
worshippeth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>
And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out,      
saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And the whole city was filled with confusion:   
and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in 
travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And when Paul would have entered  
in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And certain of the chief of Asia, 
which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure 
himself into the theatre.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>      
32</H4></TD><TD><P>Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the    
assembly was confused: and the more part knew not wherefore they were come      
together.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And 
Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the      
people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>But  
when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two     
hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the townclerk had        
appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth 
not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess     
Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>Seeing then that these things     
cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>For ye have     
brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet        
blasphemers of your goddess.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>   
38</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with     
him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies:    
let them implead one another.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>  
39</H4></TD><TD><P>But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it     
shall be determined in a lawful assembly.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>For we are in danger to be called in question   
for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of   
this concourse.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
