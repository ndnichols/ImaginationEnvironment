<p>1. To help and favour Vatsa now, O A&#347;vins, come ye hitherward.<br> Bestow on him a dwelling spacious and secure, and keep malignities away.<br> 2 All manliness that is in heaven, with the Five Tribes, or in mid-air,<br> Bestow, ye A&#347;vins, upon us.<br> 3 Remember Ka&#7751;va first of all among the singers, A&#347;vins, who<br> Have thought upon your wondrous deeds.<br> 4 A&#347;vins, for you with song of praise this hot oblation is effused,<br> This your sweet Soma juice, ye Lords of ample wealth, through which ye think upon the foe.<br> 5 Whatever ye have done in floods, in the tree, Wonder-Workers, and in growing plants,<br> Therewith, O A&#347;vins, succour me.<br> 6 What force, N&#257;satyas, ye exert, whatever, Gods, ye tend and heal,<br> This your own Vatsa gains not by his hymns alone: ye visit him who offers gifts.<br> 7 Now hath the &#7770;&#7779;i splendidly thought out the A&#347;vins' hymn of praise.<br> Let the Atharvan pour the warm oblation forth, and Soma very rich in sweets.<br> 8 Ye A&#347;vins, now ascend your car that lightly rolls upon its way.<br> May these my praises make you speed hitherward like a cloud of heaven.<br> 9 When, O N&#257;satyas, we this day make you speed hither with our hymns,<br> Or, A&#347;vins, with our songs of praise, remember Kanya specially.<br> 10 As erst Kak&#7779;&#299;v&#257;n and the &#7770;&#7779;i Vya&#347;va, as erst D&#299;rghatamas invoked your presence,<br> Or, in the sacrificial chambers, Vainya P&#7771;thi, so be ye mindful of us here, O A&#347;vins.<br> 11 Come as home-guardians, saving us from foemen, guarding our living creatures and our bodies,<br> Come to the house to give us seed and offspring,<br> 12 Whether with Indra ye be faring, A&#347;vins, or resting in one dwelling-place with V&#257;yu,<br> In concord with the &#7770;bhus or &#256;dityas, or standing still in Vi&#7779;&#7751;u's striding-places.<br> 13 When I, O A&#347;vins, call on you to-day that I may gather strength,<br> Or as all-conquering might in war, be that the A&#347;vins' noblest grace.<br> 14 Now come, ye A&#347;vins, hitherward: here are oblations set for you;<br> These Soma-draughts to aid Yadu and<br> Turva&#347;a, these offered you mid Kaniva's Sons.<br> 15 Whatever healing balm is yours, Nisatyas, near or far away,<br> Therewith, great Sages, grant a home to Vatsa and to Vimada.<br> 16 Together with the Goddess, with the A&#347;vins' Speech have I awoke.<br> Thou, Goddess, hast disclosed the hymn, and holy gift from mortal men.<br> 17 Awake the A&#347;vins, Goddess Dawn! Up Mighty Lady of sweet strains!<br> Rise, straightway, priest of sacrifice! High glory to the gladdening draught!<br> 18 Thou, Dawn, approaching with thy light shinest together with the Sun,<br> And to this man-protecting home the chariot ofthe A&#347;vins comes.<br> 19 When yellow stalks give forth the juice, as cows from udders pour their milk,<br> And voices sound the song of praise, the A&#347;vins' worshippers show first.<br> 20 Forward for glory and for strength, protection that shall conquer men,<br> And power and skill, most sapient Ones!<br> 21 When A&#347;vins, worthy of our lauds, ye seat you in the father's house.<br> With wisdom or the bliss ye bring.</p>
