<p>1 I GLORIFY that Ram who finds the light of heaven, whose hundred nobly-natured ones go forth with him.<br> With hymns may I turn hither Indra to mine aid,&#151;the Car which like a strong steed hasteth to the call.<br> 2 Like as a mountain on firm basis, unremoved, he, thousandfold protector, waxed in mighty strength,<br> When Indra, joying in the draughts of Soma juice, forced the clouds, slaying V&#7771;tra stayer of their flow.<br> 3 For he stays e&#146;en the stayers, spread o&#146;er laden cloud, rooted in light, strengthened in rapture by the wise.<br> Indra with thought, with skilled activity, I call, most liberal giver, for he sates him with the juice.<br> 4 Whom those that flow in heaven on sacred grass, his own assistants, nobly-natured, fill full like the sea,&#151;<br> Beside that Indra when he smote down V&#7771;tra stood his helpers, straight in form, mighty, invincible.<br> 5 To him, as in wild joy he fought with him who stayed the rain, his helpers sped like swift streams down a slope,<br> When Indra, thunder-armed, made bold by Soma draughts, as T&#7771;ta cleaveth Vala's fences, cleft him through.<br> 6 Splendour encompassed thee, forth shone thy warrior might: the rain-obstructer lay in mid-air's lowest deep,<br> What time, O Indra, thou didst cast thy thunder down upon the jaws of V&#7771;itra hard to be restrained.<br> 7 The hymns which magnify thee, Indra, reach to thee even as water-brooks flow down and fill the lake.<br> Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar gave yet more force to thine appropriate strength, and forged thy thunderbolt of overpowering might.<br> 8 When, Indra, thou whose power is linked with thy Bay Steeds hadst smitten V&#7771;tra, causing floods to flow for man,<br> Thou heldst in thine arms the metal thunderbolt, and settest in the heaven the Sun for all to see.<br> 9 In fear they raised the lofty self-resplendent hymn, praise giving and effectual, leading up to heaven,<br> When Indra's helpers fighting for the good of men, the Maruts, faithful to mankind, joyed in the light.<br> 10 Then Heaven himself, the mighty, at that Dragon's roar reeled back in terror when, Indra, thy thunderbolt<br> In the wild joy of Soma had struck off with might the head of V&#7771;tra, tyrant of the earth and heaven.<br> 11 O Indra, were this earth extended forth tenfold, and men who dwell therein multiplied day by day,<br> Still here thy conquering might, Maghavan, would be famed: it hath waxed vast as heaven in majesty and power.<br> 12 Thou, bold of heart, in thine own native might, for help, upon the limit of this mid-air and of heaven,<br> Hast made the earth to be the pattern of thy strength: embracing flood and light thou reachest to the sky.<br> 13 Thou art the counterpart of earth, the Master of lofty heaven with all its mighty Heroes:<br> Thou hast filled all the region with thy greatness: yea, of a truth there is none other like thee.<br> 14 Whose amplitude the heaven and earth have not attained, whose bounds the waters of mid-air have never reached,&#151;<br> Not, when in joy he fights the stayer of the rain: thou, and none else, hast made all things in order due.<br> 15 The Maruts sang thy praise in this encounter, and in thee all the Deities delighted,<br> What time thou, Indra, with thy spiky weapon, thy deadly bolt, smotest the face of V&#7771;tra.</p>
