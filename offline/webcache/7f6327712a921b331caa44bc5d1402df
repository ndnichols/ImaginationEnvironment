<p>1 AGNI and Soma, mighty Pair, graciously hearken to my call,<br> Accept in friendly wise my hymn, and prosper him who offers gifts.<br> 2 The man who honours you to-day, Agni and Soma, with this hymn,<br> Bestow on him heroic strength, increase of kine, and noble steeds.<br> 3 The man who offers holy oil and burnt oblations unto you,<br> Agni and Soma, shall enjoy great strength, with offspring, all his life.<br> 4 Agni and Soma, famed is that your. prowess wherewith ye stole the kine, his food, from Pa&#7751;i.<br> Ye caused the brood of B&#7771;saya to perish; ye found the light, the single light for many.<br> 5 Agni and Soma, joined in operation ye have set up the shining lights in heaven.<br> From curse and from reproach, Agni and Soma, ye freed the rivers that were bound in fetters.<br> 6 One of you M&#257;tari&#347;van brought from heaven, the Falcon rent the other from the mountain.<br> Strengthened by holy prayer Agni and Soma have made us ample room for sacrificing.<br> 7 Taste, Agni, Soma, this prepared oblation; accept it, Mighty Ones, and let it please you.<br> Vouchsafe us good protection and kind favour: grant to the sacrificer health and riches.<br> 8 Whoso with oil and poured oblation honours, with God-devoted heart, Agni and Soma,&#151;<br> Protect his sacrifice, preserve him from distress, grant to the sacrificer great felicity.<br> 9 Invoked together, mates in wealth, Agni-Soma, accept our hymns:<br> Together be among the Gods.<br> 10 Agni and Soma, unto him who worships you with holy oil<br> Shine forth an ample recompense.<br> 11 Agni and Soma, be ye pleased with these oblations brought to you,<br> And come, together, nigh to us.<br> 12 Agni and Soma, cherish well our horses, and let our cows be fat who yield oblations.<br> Grant power to us and to our wealthy patrons, and cause our holy rites to be successful.</p>
