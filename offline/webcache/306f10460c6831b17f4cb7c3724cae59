Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And he went, and     
fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savory meat, such  
as his father loved.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were  
with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And she put the skins of  
the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:</P></TD>

savory meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son     
Jacob.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And

thou, my son?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I have done        
according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison,     
that thy soul may bless me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>

it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because YHVH thy ELOHIYM brought it to      
me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And      
Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son,    
whether thou be my very son Esau or not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

of Esau.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's       
hands: so he blessed him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>      
24</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I       
am.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And he   
said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may 
bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him   
wine and he drank.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my       
son.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And he  
came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed 
him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which YHVH   
hath blessed:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Therefore ELOHIYM give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the     
earth, and plenty of corn and wine:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29>
<H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be  
lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be   
every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, as   
soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone  
out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from   
his hunting.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>
And he also had made savory meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto 
his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul    
may bless me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, 
thy firstborn Esau.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that     
hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou      
camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>And when Esau heard the words 
of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto    
his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, Thy brother came     
with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, Is not he rightly    
named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my         
birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast  
thou not reserved a blessing for me?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold,  
I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for          
servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now  
unto thee, my son?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father?    
bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>And Isaac his   
father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of 
the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt  
serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, 
that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>And Esau hated Jacob because of   
the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The  
days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother         
Jacob.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called 
Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching 
thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>Now therefore, my son, obey my    
voice; arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>And tarry with him a few days,    
until thy brother's fury turn away;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45>
<H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P>Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he    
forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from  
thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46><H4>46</H4></TD><TD><P>And Rebekah said to Isaac, I  
am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of   
the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land,    
what good shall my life do me?</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
