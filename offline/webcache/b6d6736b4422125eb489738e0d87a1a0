<p>1. I MOVE before thee here present in person, and all the Deities follow behind me.<br> When, Indra, thou securest me my portion, with me thou shalt perform heroic actions.<br> 2 The food of meath in foremost place I give thee, thy Soma shall be pressed, thy share appointed.<br> Thou on my right shalt be my friend and comrade: then shall we two smite dead full many a foeman.<br> 3 Striving for strength bring forth a laud to Indra, a truthful hymn if he in truth existeth.<br> One and another say, There is no Indra. Who hath beheld him? Whom then shall we honour?<br> 4 Here am I, look upon me here, O singer. All that existeth 1 surpass in greatness.<br> The Holy Law's commandments make me mighty. Rending with strength I rend the worlds asunder.<br> 5 When the Law's lovers mounted and ap. proached me as 1 sate lone upon the dear sky's summit.<br> Then spake my spirit to the heart within me, My friends have cried unto me with their children.<br> 6 All these thy deeds must be declared at Soma-feasts, wrought, Indra, Bounteous Lord, for him who sheds the juice,<br> When thou didst open wealth heaped up by many, brought from far away to Sarablia, the &#7770;&#7779;i's kin.<br> 7 Now run ye forth your several ways: he is not here who kept you back.<br> For hath not Indra sunk his bolt deep down in V&#7771;tra's vital part?<br> 8 On-rushing with the speed of thought within the iron fort he pressed:<br> The Falcon went to heaven and brought the Soma to the Thunderer.<br> 9 Deep in the ocean lies the bolt with waters compassed round about,<br> And in continuous onward flow the floods their tribute bring to it.<br> 10 When, uttering words which no one comprehended, V&#257;k, Queen of Gods, the Gladdener, was seated,<br> The heaven's four regions drew forth drink and vigour: now whither hath her noblest portion vanished?<br> 11 The Deities generated V&#257;k the Goddess, and animals of every figure speak her.<br> May she, the Gladdener, yielding food and vigour, the Milch-cow V&#257;k, approach us meetly lauded.<br> 12 Step forth with wider stride, my comrade Vi&#7779;&#7751;u; make room, Dyaus, for the leaping of the lightning.<br> Let us slay V&#7771;tra, let us free the rivers let them flow loosed at the command of Indra.</p>
