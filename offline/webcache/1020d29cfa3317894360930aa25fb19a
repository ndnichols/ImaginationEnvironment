<p>1. Who knows the birth of these, or who lived in the Maruts&#146; favour in the days of old<br> What time their spotted deer were yoked?<br> 2 Who, when they stood upon their cars, hath heard them tell the way they went?<br> Who was the bounteous man to whom their kindred rains flowed down with food of sacrifice?<br> 3 To me they told it, and they came with winged steeds radiant to the draught,<br> Youths, Heroes free from spot or stain: Behold us here and praise thou us;<br> 4 Who shine self-luminous with ornaments and swords, with breastplates, armlets, and with wreaths,<br> Arrayed on chariots and with bows.<br> 5 O swift to pour your bounties down, ye Maruts, with delight I look upon your cars,<br> Like splendours coming through the rain.<br> 6 Munificent Heroes, they have cast heaven's treasury down for the worshipper's behoof:<br> They set the storm-cloud free to stream through both the worlds, and rainfloods flow o&#146;er desert spots.<br> 7 The bursting streams m billowy flood have spread abroad, like milch-kine, o&#146;er the firmament.<br> Like swift steeds hasting to their journey's resting-place, to every side run glittering brooks.<br> 8 Hither, O Maruts, come from heaven, from mid-air, or from near at hand<br> Tarry not far away from us.<br> 9 So let not Ras&#257;, Krumu, or Anitabha, Kubha, or Sindhu hold you back.<br> Let not the watery Sarayti obstruct your way. With us be all the bliss ye give.<br> 10 That brilliant gathering of your cars, the company of Maruts, of the Youthful Ones,<br> The rain-showers, speeding on, attend.<br> 11 With eulogies and hymns may we follow your army, troop by troop, and band by band,<br> And company by company.<br> 12 To what oblation-giver, sprung of noble ancestry, have sped<br> The Maruts on this course to-day?<br> 13 Vouchsafe to us the bounty, that which we implore, through which, for child and progeny,<br> Ye give the seed of corn that wasteth not away, and bliss that reacheth to all life.<br> 14 May we in safety pass by those who slander us, leaving behind disgrace and hate.<br> Maruts, may we be there when ye, at dawn, in rest and toil, rain waters down and balm.<br> 15 Favoured by Gods shall he the man, O Heroes, Marutr! and possessed of noble sons,<br> Whom ye protect. Such may we be.<br> 16 Praise the Free-givers. At this liberal patron's rite they joy like cattle in the mead.<br> So call thou unto them who come as ancient Friends: hymn those who love thee with a song.</p>
