upon him, and kissed him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his      
father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

him threescore and ten days.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>

unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes,      
speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there

father, and I will come again.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>

<P>And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants

Egypt,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And all 
the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their       
little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of        
Goshen.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great      
company.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they

father seven days.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning

wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan.</P>

did unto him according as he commanded them:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>For his sons carried him into the land of       
Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham     
bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, 
before Mamre.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up   
with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And when Joseph's brethren    
saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us,    
and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And they sent a messenger 
unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>So shall ye say unto 
Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin;  
for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the 
servants of the ELOHIYM of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto     
him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And his 
brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be  
thy servants.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of ELOHIYM?</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>But as for you, 
ye thought evil against me; but ELOHIYM meant it unto good, to bring to pass,   
as it is this day, to save much people alive.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish    
you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto         
them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred  
and ten years.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also 
of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And Joseph said unto his  
brethren, I die: and ELOHIYM will surely visit you, and bring you out of this   
land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And Joseph took an   
oath of the children of Israel, saying, ELOHIYM will surely visit you, and ye   
shall carry up my bones from hence.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26>
<H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and  
they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
