1</H4></TD><TD><P>And after six days YAHSHUA taketh Peter, James, and John his  
brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And was transfigured before them:   
and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And, behold,      
there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Then answered Peter, and said unto  
YAHSHUA, ADONAY, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here   
three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>While he yet spake,    
behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud,  
which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the      
disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA came and        
touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they had lifted up their   
eyes, they saw no man, save YAHSHUA only.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And as they came down from the mountain, YAHSHUA  
charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen  
again from the dead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that  
Elias must first come?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first    
come, and restore all things.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>  
12</H4></TD><TD><P>But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they     
knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall     
also the Son of man suffer of them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13>
<H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of 
John the Baptist.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain    
man, kneeling down to him, and saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>ADONAY, have mercy on my son: for he is         
lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into   
the water.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Then YAHSHUA answered and 
said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how    
long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA rebuked the devil;    
and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Then came the   
disciples to YAHSHUA apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA said     
unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have      
faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence 
to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto      
you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Howbeit 
this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And while they abode in Galilee,  
YAHSHUA said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of      
men:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And     
they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were  
exceeding sorry.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money   
came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>He saith, Yes. And when he was    
come into the house, YAHSHUA prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon?  
of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own          
children, or of strangers?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>

sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou 
hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give    
unto them for me and thee.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright
