<p>1. THESE first, the boundless Sea, and M&#257;tari&#347;van, fierce-glowing Fire, the Strong, the Bliss-bestower.<br> And heavenly Floods, first-born by holy Order, exclaimed against the outrage on a Brahman.<br> 2 King Soma first of all, without reluctance, made restitution of the Brahman's consort.<br> Mitra and Varu&#7751;a were the inviters: Agni as Hota; took her hand and led her.<br> 3 The man, her pledge, must by her hand be taken when they have cried, She is a Brahman's consort.<br> She stayed not for a herald to conduct her: thus is the kingdom of a ruler guarded.<br> 4 Thus spake of her those Gods of old, Seven &#7770;&#7779;is who sate them down to their austere devotion:<br> Dire is a Brahman's wife led home by others: in the supremest heaven she plants confusion.<br> 5 The Brahmacari goes engaged in duty: he is a member of the Gods&#146; own body.<br> Through him B&#7771;haspati obtained his consort, as the Gods gained the ladle brought by Soma.<br> 6 So then the Gods restored her, so men gave the woman back again.<br> The Kings who kept their promises restored the Brahman's wedded wife,<br> 7 Having restored the Brahman's wife, and freed them, with Gods&#146; aid, from sin,<br> They shared the fulness of the earth, and won themselves extended sway.</p>
