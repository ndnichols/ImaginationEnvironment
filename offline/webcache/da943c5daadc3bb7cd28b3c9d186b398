<p>1. WHEN-men, B&#7771;haspati, giving names to objects, sent out V&#257;k's first and earliest utterances,<br> All that was excellent and spotless, treasured within them, was disclosed through their affection.<br> 2 Where, like men cleansing corn-flour in a cribble, the wise in spirit have created language,<br> Friends see and recognize the marks of friendship: their speech retains the blessed sign imprinted.<br> 3 With sacrifice the trace of V&#257;k they foIlowed, and found her harbouring within the &#7770;&#7779;is.<br> They brought her, dealt her forth in many places: seven singers make her tones resound in concert.<br> 4 One man hath ne&#146;er seen V&#257;k, and yet he seeth: one man hath hearing but hath never heard her.<br> But to another hath she shown her beauty as a fond well-dressed woman to her husband.<br> 5 One man they call a laggard, dull in friendship: they never urge him on to deeds of valour.<br> He wanders on in profitless illusion: the Voice he heard yields neither fruit,nor blossom.<br> 6 No part in V&#257;k hath he who hath abandoned his own dear friend who knows the truth of friendship.<br> Even if he hears her still in vain he listens: naught knows he of the path of righteous action.<br> 7 Unequal in the quickness of their spirit are friends endowed alike with eyes and hearing.<br> Some look like tanks that reach the mouth or shoulder, others like pools of water fit to bathe in.<br> 8 When friendly Brahmans sacrifice together with mental impulse which the heart hath fashioned,<br> They leave one far behind through their attainments, and some who count as Brahmans wander elsewhere.<br> 9 Those men who step not back and move not forward, nor Brahmans nor preparers of libations,<br> Having attained to V&#257;k in sinful fashion spin out their thread in ignorance like spinsters.<br> 10 All friends are joyful in the friend who cometh in triumph, having conquered in assembly.<br> He is their blame-averter, food-provider prepared is he and fit for deed of vigour.<br> 11 One plies his constant task reciting verses. one sings the holy psalm in Sakvari measures.<br> One more, the Brahman, tells the lore of being, and one lays down the rules of sacrificing.</p>
