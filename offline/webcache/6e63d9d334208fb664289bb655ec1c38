<p>1. OF this benignant Priest, with eld grey-coloured, the brother midmost of the three is lightning.<br> The third is he whose back with oil is sprinkled. Here I behold the Chief with seven male children.<br> 2 Seven to the one-wheeled chariot yoke the Courser; bearing seven names the single Courser draws it.<br> Three-naved the wheel is, sound and undecaying, whereon are resting all these worlds of being.<br> 3 The seven who on the seven-wheeled car are mounted have horses, seven in tale, who draw them onward.<br> Seven Sisters utter songs of praise together, in whom the names of the seven Cows are treasured.<br> 4 Who hath beheld him as he sprang to being, seen how the boneless One supports the bony?<br> Where is the blood of earth, the life, the spirit? Who may approach the man who knows, to ask it?<br> 5 Unripe in mind, in spirit undiscerning, I ask of these the Gods&#146; established places;<br> For up above the yearling Calf the sages, to form a web, their own seven threads have woven.<br> 6 I ask, unknowing, those who know, the sages, as one all ignorant for sake of knowledge,<br> What was that ONE who in the Unborn's image hath stablished and fixed firm these worlds' six regions.<br> 7 Let him who knoweth presently declare it, this lovely Bird's securely founded station.<br> Forth from his head the Cows draw milk, and, wearing his vesture, with their foot have drunk the water.<br> 8 The Mother gave the Sire his share of Order: with thought, at first, she wedded him in spirit.<br> She, the coy Dame, was filled with dew prolific: with adoration men approached to praise her.<br> 9 Yoked was the Mother to the boon Cow's car-pole: in the dank rows of cloud the Infant rested.<br> Then the Calf lowed, and looked upon the Mother, the Cow who wears all shapes in three directions.<br> 10 Bearing three Mothers and three Fathers, single he stood erect: they never make him weary.<br> There on the pitch of heaven they speak together in speech all-knowing but not all-impelling.<br> 11 Formed with twelve spokes, by length of time, unweakened, rolls round the heaven this wheel of during Order.<br> Herein established, joined in pairs together, seven hundred Sons and twenty stand, O Agni.<br> 12 They call him in the farther half of heaven the Sire five-footed, of twelve forms, wealthy in watery store.<br> These others say that he, God with far-seeing eyes, is mounted on the lower seven-wheeled, six-spoked car.<br> 13 Upon this five-spoked wheel revolving ever all living creatures rest and are dependent.<br> Its axle, heavy-laden, is not heated: the nave from ancient time remains unbroken.<br> 14 The wheel revolves, unwasting, with its felly: ten draw it, yoked to the far-stretching car-pole.<br> The Sun's eye moves encompassed by the region: on him dependent rest all living creatures.<br> 15 Of the co-born they call the seventh single-born; the six twin pairs are called &#7770;&#7779;is, Children of Gods.<br> Their good gifts sought of men are ranged in order due, and various in their form move for the Lord who guides.<br> 16 They told me these were males, though truly females: he who hath eyes sees this, the blind discerns not.<br> The son who is a sage hath comprehended: who knows this rightly is his father's father.<br> 17 Beneath the upper realm, above this lower, bearing her calf at foot the Cow hath risen.<br> Witherward, to what place hath she departed? Where calves she? Not amid this herd of cattle.<br> 18 Who, that the father of this Calf discerneth beneath the upper realm, above the lower,<br> Showing himself a sage, may here declare it? Whence hath the Godlike spirit had its rising?<br> 19 Those that come hitherward they call departing, those that depart they call directed hither.<br> And what so ye have made, Indra and Soma, steeds bear as &#146;twere yoked to the region's car-pole.<br> 20 Two Birds with fair wings, knit with bonds of friendship, in the same sheltering tree have found a refuge.<br> One of the twain eats the sweet Fig-tree's fruitage; the other eating not regardeth only.<br> 21 Where those fine Birds hymn ceaselessly their portion of life eternal, and the sacred synods,<br> There is the Universe's mighty Keeper, who, wise, hath entered into me the simple.<br> 22 The, tree whereon the fine Birds eat the sweetness, where they all rest and procreate their offspring,&#151;<br> Upon its top they say the fig is luscious: none gaineth it who knoweth not the Father.<br> 23 How on the G&#257;yatr&#299; the G&#257;yatr&#299; was based, how from the Tri&#7779;&#7789;up they fashioned the Tri&#7779;&#7789;up forth,<br> How on the Jagat&#299; was based the Jagat&#299;,&#151;they who know this have won themselves immortal life.<br> 24 With G&#257;yatr&#299; he measures out the praise-song, S&#257;ma with praise-song, triplet with the Tri&#7779;&#7789;up.<br> The triplet with the two or four-foot measure, and with the syllable they form seven metres.<br> 25 With Jagat&#299; the flood in heaven he stablished, and saw the Sun in the Rathantara S&#257;man.<br> G&#257;yatr&#299; hath, they say, three brands for kindling: hence it excels in majesty and vigour.<br> 26 I invocate the milch-cow good for milking so that the milker, deft of hand, may drain her.<br> May Savitar give goodliest stimulation. The caldron is made hot; I will proclaim it.<br> 27 She, lady of all treasure, is come hither yearning in spirit for her calf and lowing.<br> May this cow yield her milk for both the A&#347;vins, and may she prosper to our high advantage.<br> 28 The cow hath lowed after her blinking youngling; she licks his forehead, as she lows, to form it.<br> His mouth she fondly calls to her warm udder, and suckles him with milk while gently lowing.<br> 29 He also snorts, by whom encompassed round the Cow laws as she clings unto the shedder of the rain.<br> She with her shrilling cries hath humbled mortal man, and, turned to lightning, hath stripped off her covering robe.<br> 30 That which hath breath and speed and life and motion lies firmly stablished in the midst of houses.<br> Living, by offerings to the Dead he moveth Immortal One, the brother of the mortal.<br> 31 I saw the Herdsman, him who never stumbles, approaching by his pathways and departing.<br> He, clothed with gathered and diffusive splendour, within the worlds continually travels.<br> 32 He who hath made him cloth not comprehend him: from him who saw him surely is he hidden.<br> He, yet enveloped in his Mother's bosom, source of much life, hath sunk into destruction.<br> 33 Dyaus is my Father, my begetter: kinship is here. This great earth is my kin and Mother.<br> Between the wide-spread world-halves is the birth-place: the Father laid the Daughter's germ within it.<br> 34 I ask thee of the earth's extremest limit, where is the centre of the world, I ask thee.<br> I ask thee of the Stallion's seed prolific, I ask of highest heaven where Speech abideth.<br> 35 This altar is the earth's extremest limit; this sacrifice of ours is the world's centre.<br> The Stallion's seed prolific is the Soma; this Brahman highest heaven where Speech abideth.<br> 36 Seven germs unripened yet are heaven's prolific seed: their functions they maintain by Vi&#7779;&#7751;u's ordinance.<br> Endued with wisdom through intelligence and thought, they compass us about present on every side.<br> 37 What thing I truly am I know not clearly: mysterious, fettered in my mind I wander.<br> When the first-born of holy Law approached me, then of this speech I first obtain a portion.<br> 38 Back, forward goes he, grasped by strength inherent, the Immortal born the brother of the mortal<br> Ceaseless they move in opposite directions: men mark the one, and fail to mark the other.<br> 39 Upon what syllable of holy praise-song, as twere their highest heaven, the Gods repose them,&#151;<br> Who knows not this, what will he do with praise-song? But they who know it well sit here assembled.<br> 40 <A HREF="errata.htm#5">Fortunate</A> mayst thou be with goodly pasture, and may we also be exceeding wealthy.<br> Feed on the grass, O Cow, at every season, and coming hitherward drink limpid water.<br> 41 Forming the water-floods, the buffalo hath lowed, one-footed or two-footed or four-footed, she,<br> Who hath become eight-footed or hath got nine feet, the thousand-syllabled in the sublimest heaven.<br> 42 From her descend in streams the seas of water; thereby the world's four regions have their being,<br> Thence flows the imperishable flood and thence the universe hath life.<br> 43 I saw from far away the smoke of fuel with spires that rose on high o&#146;er that beneath it.<br> The Mighty Men have dressed the spotted bullock. These were the customs in the days aforetime,<br> 44 Three with long tresses show in ordered season. One of them sheareth when the year is ended.<br> One with his powers the universe regardeth: Of one, the sweep is seen, but his figure.<br> 45 Speech hath been measured out in four divisions, the Brahmans who have understanding know them.<br> Three kept in close concealment cause no motion; of speech, men speak only the fourth division.<br> 46 They call him Indra, Mitra, Varu&#7751;a, Agni, and he is heavenly nobly-winged Garutm&#257;n.<br> To what is One, sages give many a title they call it Agni, Yama, M&#257;tari&#347;van.<br> 47 Dark the descent: the birds are golden-coloured; up to the heaven they fly robed in the waters.<br> Again descend they from the seat of Order, and all the earth is moistened with their fatness.<br> 48 Twelve are the fellies, and the wheel is single; three are the naves. What man hath understood it?<br> Therein are set together spokes three hundred and sixty, which in nowise can be loosened.<br> 49 That breast of thine exhaustless, spring of pleasure, wherewith thou feedest all things that are choicest,<br> Wealth-giver, treasure. finder, free bestower,&#151;bring that, Sarasvat&#299;, that we may drain it.<br> 50 By means of sacrifice the Gods accomplished their sacrifice: these were the earliest ordinances.<br> These Mighty Ones attained the height of heaven, there where the S&#257;dhyas, Gods of old, are dwelling.<br> 51 Uniform, with the passing days, this water mounts and fails again.<br> The tempest-clouds give life to earth, and fires re-animate the heaven.<br> 52 The Bird Celestial, vast with noble pinion, the lovely germ of plants, the germ of waters,<br> Him who delighteth us with rain in season, Sarasv&#257;n I invoke that he may help us.</p>
