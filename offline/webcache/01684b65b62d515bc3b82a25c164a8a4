Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world:</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Both low and high,     
rich and poor, together.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart      
shall be of understanding.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4>
</TD><TD><P>I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying    
upon the harp.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>
Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels      
shall compass me about?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the        
multitude of their riches;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4>
</TD><TD><P>None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to       
ELOHIYM a ransom for him:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>(For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for   
ever:)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>That he 
should still live for ever, and not see corruption.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>For he seeth that wise men die,   
likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to      
others.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>     
Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their   
dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own       
names.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>      
Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that        
perish.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>This 
their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Like sheep they 
are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have     
dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave  
from their dwelling.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>But ELOHIYM will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he 
shall receive me. Selah.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his     
house is increased;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD>
<TD><P>For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not       
descend after him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee,     
when thou doest well to thyself.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19>   
<H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall 
never see light.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD>
