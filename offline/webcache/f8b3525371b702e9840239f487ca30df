</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>Would ye could    
bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>For I am jealous over you with  
godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you  
as a chaste virgin to MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>
3</H4></TD><TD><P>But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve    
through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity     
that is in MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD>
<TD><P>For if he that cometh preacheth another YAHSHUA, whom we have not        
preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or       
another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>For I suppose I   
was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>But though I be rude in speech, yet 
not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all     
things.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Have I 
committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have 
preached to you the gospel of ELOHIYM freely?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, 
to do you service.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: 
for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia         
supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you,  
and so will I keep myself.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>     
10</H4></TD><TD><P>As the truth of MASHIYACH is in me, no man shall stop me of  
this boasting in the regions of Achaia.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore? because I love you not? ELOHIYM      
knoweth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>But 
what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire   
occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>For such are false        
apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of       
MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore it is no   
great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of            
righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>I say again, Let no man think 
me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a    
little.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>That 
which I speak, I speak it not after the ADONAY, but as it were foolishly, in    
this confidence of boasting.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>   
18</H4></TD><TD><P>Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory         
also.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>For ye 
suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>For ye suffer, if a man bring you 
into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt         
himself, if a man smite you on the face.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>I speak as concerning reproach, as though we    
had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am     
bold also.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of   
Abraham? so am I.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Are they ministers of MASHIYACH? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in       
labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in   
deaths oft.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Thrice was I beaten with rods,    
once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been   
in the deep;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>
In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by   
mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils 
in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>In weariness    
and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often,   
in cold and nakedness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me     
daily, the care of all the churches.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is          
offended, and I burn not?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>      
30</H4></TD><TD><P>If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which

which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>In Damascus the governor under    
Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to    
apprehend me:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his 
hands.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M.
