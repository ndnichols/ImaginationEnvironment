<TD><P>And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went  
through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did    
eat, rubbing them in their hands.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2>   
<H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye    
that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA answering them said,    
Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was an hungred,  
and they which were with him;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>   
4</H4></TD><TD><P>How he went into the house of ELOHIYM, and did take and eat   
the shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful 
to eat but for the priests alone?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5>   
<H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, That the Son of man is ADOWN also  
of the sabbath.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the        
synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And the scribes   
and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they  
might find an accusation against him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man   
which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he      
arose and stood forth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Then said YAHSHUA unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful 
on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy      
it?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And      
looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy      
hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And they were filled with 
madness; and communed one with another what they might do to YAHSHUA.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass  
in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all      
night in prayer to ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>    
13</H4></TD><TD><P>And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and   
of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Simon, (whom he also named        
Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Matthew and Thomas,  
James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And Judas the brother of James,   
and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And he came down with them, and stood in the 
plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of 
all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came  
to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And they that were vexed with     
unclean spirits: and they were healed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And the whole multitude sought to touch him:    
for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And he lifted up his eyes on his  
disciples, and said, Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of EL.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Blessed are ye  
that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye   
shall laugh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>
Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from  
their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the  
Son of man's sake.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is    
great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>But woe unto    
you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Woe unto you that are full! for   
ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>Woe unto you,   
when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false     
prophets.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>   
But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate    
you,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Bless   
them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And unto him that smiteth 
thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak  
forbid not to take thy coat also.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30>  
<H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that   
taketh away thy goods ask them not again.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And as ye would that men should do to you, do   
ye also to them likewise.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>      
32</H4></TD><TD><P>For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for  
sinners also love those that love them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And if ye do good to them which do good to you, 
what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>And if ye lend to them of whom ye 
hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to       
receive as much again.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing 
again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the      
ELYOWN: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>Be ye therefore merciful, as  
your Father also is merciful.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>  
37</H4></TD><TD><P>Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye   
shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>Give, and it shall be given unto  
you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall   
men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it      
shall be measured to you again.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>
39</H4></TD><TD><P>And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the     
blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>The disciple is not above his master: but    
every one that is perfect shall be as his master.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>And why beholdest thou the mote   
that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own  
eye?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>Either  
how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in 
thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye?   
Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt    
thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>For a good tree      
bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good  
fruit.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>For   
every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor 
of a bramble bush gather they grapes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P>A good man out of the good treasure of his      
heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil        
treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance   
of the heart his mouth speaketh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46>   
<H4>46</H4></TD><TD><P>And why call ye me, ADONAY, ADONAY, and do not the       
things which I say?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>47</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will   
shew you to whom he is like:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V48><H4>   
48</H4></TD><TD><P>He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and  
laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat        
vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a   
rock.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V49><H4>49</H4></TD><TD><P>But he 
that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an   
house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and         
immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
