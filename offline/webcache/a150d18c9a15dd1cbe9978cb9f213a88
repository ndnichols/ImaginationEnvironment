<p>1. Enjoy thy fill of meath out of the Hotar's cup: Adhvaryus he desires a full draught poured for him.<br> Bring it him: seeking this he gives. Granter of Wealth, drink Soma with the &#7770;tus from the Hotar's cup.<br> 2 He whom of old I called on, him I call on now. He is to be invoked; his name is He who Gives,<br> Here brought by priests is Soma meath. Granter of Wealth, drink Soma with the &#7770;tus from the Potar's cup.<br> 3 Fat may the horses be wherewith thou speedest on: Lord of the Wood, unharming, strengthen thou thyself.<br> Drawing and seizing, Bold One, thou who grantest wealth, drink Soma with the &#7770;tus from the Ne&#7779;&#7789;ar's cup.<br> 4 From Hotar's cup and Potar's he hath drunk and joyed: the proffered food hath pleased him from the Ne&#7779;&#7789;ar's bowl.<br> The fourth cup undisturbed, immortal, let him drink who giveth wealth, the cup of the wealth-giving God.<br> 5 Yoke, O ye Twain, to-day your hero-bearing car, swift-moving hitherward: your loosing-place is here.<br> Mix the oblations, then come hither with the meath, and drink the Soma, ye rich in abundant strength.<br> 6 Agni, accept the fuel and our offered gift: accept the prayer of man, accept our eulogy,<br> Do thou with all, with &#7770;tu, O thou Excellent, fain, make the great Gods all fain taste the gift we bring.</p>
