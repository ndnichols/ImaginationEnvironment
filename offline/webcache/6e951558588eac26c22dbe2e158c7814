<TD><P>And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the 
mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And saith unto them, Go your way    
into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye     
shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And if any man    
say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the ADONAY hath need of him; and      
straightway he will send him hither.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4>
<H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the   
door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And certain of them that    
stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And they said unto them even as     
YAHSHUA had commanded: and they let them go.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And they brought the colt to YAHSHUA, and cast    
their garments on him; and he sat upon him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And many spread their garments in the way: and    
others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And they that went     
before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed is he that      
cometh in the name of YHVH:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>    
10</H4></TD><TD><P>Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in   
the name of YHVH: Hosanna in the highest.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA entered into Jerusalem, and into    
the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the     
eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And on the morrow, when they  
were come from Bethany, he was hungry:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves,   
he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he   
found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA answered and said 
unto it, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard   
it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And they 
come to Jerusalem: and YAHSHUA went into the temple, and began to cast out them 
that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the             
moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And would not suffer that any man 
should carry any vessel through the temple.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not      
written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye    
have made it a den of thieves.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4> 
18</H4></TD><TD><P>And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how   
they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was         
astonished at his doctrine.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>    
19</H4></TD><TD><P>And when even was come, he went out of the city.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And in the morning,  
as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And Peter calling to      
remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is 
withered away.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And YAHSHUA answering saith unto them, Have faith in ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>For verily I say unto     
you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou  
cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that     
those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he     
saith.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>      
Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe   
that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye    
have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive    
you your trespasses.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in      
heaven forgive your trespasses.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>
27</H4></TD><TD><P>And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in   
the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the       
elders,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this 
authority to do these things?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>  
29</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA answered and said unto them, I will also ask of  
you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do     
these things.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And they reasoned with    
themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye  
not believe him?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men counted 
John, that he was a prophet indeed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33>
<H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And they answered and said unto YAHSHUA, We cannot tell. 
And YAHSHUA answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority  
I do these things.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by
