<p>1. GLORIFY naught besides, O friends; so shall no sorrow trouble you.<br> Praise only mighty Indra when the juice is shed, and say your lauds repeatedly:<br> 2 Even him, eternal, like a bull who rushes down, men's Conqueror, bounteous like a cow;<br> Him who is cause of both, of enmity and peace, to both sides most munificent.<br> 3 Although these men in sundry ways invoke thee to obtain thine aid,<br> Be this our prayer, addressed, O Indra, unto thee, thine exaltation every day.<br> 4 Those skilled in song, O Maghavan among these men o&#146;ercome with might the foeman's songs.<br> Come hither, bring us strength in many a varied form most near that it may succour us.<br> 5 O Caster of the Stone, I would not sell thee for a mighty price,<br> Not for a thousand, Thunderer! nor ten thousand, nor a hundred, Lord of countless wealth!<br> 6 O Indra, thou art more to me than sire or niggard brother is.<br> Thou and my mother, O Good Lord, appear alike, to give me wealth abundantly.<br> 7 Where art thou? Whither art thou gone? For many a place attracts thy mind.<br> Haste, Warrior, Fort-destroyer, Lord of battle's din, haste, holy songs have sounded forth.<br> 8 Sing out the psalm to him who breaks down castles for his faithful friend,<br> Verses to bring the Thunderer to destroy the forts and sit on Ka&#7751;va's sacred grass.<br> 9 The Horses which are thine in tens, in hundreds, yea, in thousands thine,<br> Even those vigorous Steeds, fleet-footed in the course, with those come quickly near to us.<br> 10 This day I call Sabardugh&#257; who animates the holy song,<br> Indra the richly-yielding Milch-cow who provides unfailing food in ample stream.<br> 11 When S&#363;ra wounded Eta&#347;a, with V&#257;ta's rolling winged car.<br> Indra bore Kutsa &#256;rjuneya off, and mocked Gandharva. the unconquered One.<br> 12 He without ligature, before making incision in the neck,<br> Closed up the wound again, most wealthy Maghavan, who maketh whole the injured part.<br> 13 May we be never cast aside, and strangers, as it were, to thee.<br> We, Thunder-wielding Indra, count ourselves as trees rejected and unfit to burn.<br> 14 O V&#7771;tra-slayer, we were thought slow and unready for the fray.<br> Yet once in thy great bounty may we have delight, O Hero, after praising thee.<br> 15 If he will listen to my laud, then may out Soma-drops that flow<br> Rapidly through the strainer gladden Indra, drops due to the Tugryas&#146; Strengthener.<br> 16 Come now unto the common laud of thee and of thy faithful friend.<br> So may our wealthy nobles&#146; praise give joy to thee. Fain would I sing thine eulogy.<br> 17 Press out the Soma with the stones, and in the waters wash it clean.<br> The men investing it with raiment made of milk shall milk it forth from out the stems.<br> 18 Whether thou come from earth or from the lustre of the lofty heaven,<br> Wax stronger in thy body through my song of praise: fill full all creatures, O most Wise.<br> 19 For India press the Soma out, most gladdening and most excellent.<br> May &#346;akra make it swell sent forth with every prayer and asking, as it were, for strength.<br> 20 Let me not, still beseeching thee with earnest song at Soma rites,<br> Anger thee like <A HREF="errata.htm#20">some</A> wild beast. Who would not beseech him who hath power to grant his prayer?<br> 21 The draught made swift with rapturous joy, effectual with its mighty strength,<br> All-conquering, distilling transport, let him drink: for he in ecstasy gives us gifts.<br> 22 Where bliss is not, may he, All-praised, God whom the pious glorify,<br> Bestow great wealth upon the mortal worshipper who sheds the juice and praises him.<br> 23 Come, Indra, and rejoice thyself, O God, in manifold affluence.<br> Thou fillest like a lake thy vast capacious bulk with Soma and with draughts besides.<br> 24 A thousand and a hundred Steeds are harnessed to thy golden car.<br> So may the long-maned Bays, yoked by devotion, bring Indra to drink the Soma juice.<br> 25 Yoked to thy chariot wrought of gold, may thy two Bays with peacock tails,<br> Convey thee hither, Steeds with their white backs, to quaff sweet juice that makes us eloquent.<br> 26 So drink, thou Lover of the Song, as the first drinker, of this juice.<br> This the outpouring of the savoury sap prepared is good and meet to gladden thee.<br> 27 He who alone by wondrous deed is Mighty, Strong by holy works,<br> May he come, fair of cheek; may he not stay afar, but come and turn not from our call.<br> 28 &#346;u&#7779;&#7751;a's quick moving castle thou hast crushed to pieces with thy bolts.<br> Thou, Indra, from of old, hast followed after light, since we have had thee to invoke.<br> 29 My praises when the Sun hath risen, my praises at the time of noon,<br> My praises at the coming of the gloom of night, O Vasu, have gone forth to thee.<br> 30 Praise yea, praise him. Of princes these are the most liberal of their gifts,<br> These, Paramajy&#257;, Nindit&#257;&#347;va, Prapath&#299;, most bounteous, O Medhy&#257;tithi.<br> 31 When to the car, by faith, I yoked the horses longing for the way-<br> For skilled is Yadu's son in dealing precious wealth, he who is rich in herds of kine.<br> 32 May he who gave me two brown steeds together with their cloths of gold,<br> May he, &#256;sa&#7749;ga's son Svanadratha, obtain all joy and high felicities.<br> 33 Playoga's son &#256;sa&#7749;ga, by ten thousand, O Agni, hath surpassed the rest in giving.<br> For me ten bright-hued oxen have come forward like lotus-stalks from out a lake upstanding.<br> 34 What time her husband's perfect restoration to his lost strength and manhood was apparent,<br> His consort &#346;a&#347;vat&#299; with joy addressed him, Now art thou well, my lord, and shalt be happy.</p>
