<p>1. WHAT God, of those who hear, is he whose well-praised name we may record in this our sacrifice; and how?<br> Who will be gracious? Who of many give us bliss? Who out of all the Host will come to lend us aid?<br> 2 The will and thoughts within my breast exert their power: they yearn with love, and fly to all the regions round.<br> None other comforter is found save only these: my longings and my hopes are fixt upon the Gods.<br> 3 To Nar&#257;&#347;a&#7745;sa and to P&#363;&#7779;an I sing forth, unconcealable Agni kindied by the Gods.<br> To Sun and Moon, two Moons, to Yama in the heaven, to Trita, V&#257;ta, Dawn, Night, and the Atvins Twain.<br> 4 How is the Sage extolled whom the loud singers praise? What voice, what hymn is used to laud B&#7771;haspati?<br> May Aja-Ekap&#257;d with Rkvans swift to hear, and Ahi of the Deep listen unto our call.<br> 5 Aditi, to the birth of Dak&#7779;a and the vow thou summonest the Kings Mitra and Varu&#7751;a.<br> With course unchecked, with many chariots Aryaman comes with the seven priests to tribes of varied sort.<br> 6 May all those vigorous Coursers listen to our cry, hearers of invocation, speeding on their way;<br> Winners of thousands where the priestly meed is won, who gather of themselves great wealth in every race.<br> 7 Bring ye Purandbi, bring V&#257;yu who yokes his steeds, for friendship bring ye P&#363;&#7779;an with your songs of praise:<br> They with one mind, one thought attend the sacrifice, urged by the favouring aid of Savitar the God.<br> 8 The thrice-seven wandering Rivers, yea, the mighty floods, the forest trees, the mountains, Agni to our aid,<br> K&#7771;&#347;&#257;nu, Tisya, archers to our gathering-place, and Rudra strong amid the Rudras we invoke.<br> 9 Let the great Streams come hither with their mighty help, Sindhu, Sarasvat&#299;, and Sarayu with waves.<br> Ye Goddess Floods, ye Mothers, animating all, promise us water rich in fatness and in balm.<br> 10 And let Brhaddiva, the Mother, hear our call, and Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar, Father, with the Goddesses and Dames.<br> &#7770;bhuk&#7779;an, V&#257;ja, Bhaga, and Rathaspati, and the sweet speech of him who labours guard us well!<br> 11 Pleasant to look on as a dwelling rich in food is the blest favour of the Maruts, Rudra's Sons.<br> May we be famed among the folk for wealth in kine. and ever come to you, ye Gods, with sacred food.<br> 12 The thought which ye, O Maruts, Indra and ye Gods have given to me, and ye, Mitra and Varu&#7751;a,&#151;<br> Cause this to grow and swell like a milchcow with milk. Will ye not bear away my songs upon your car?<br> 13 O Maruts, do ye never, never recollect and call again to mind this our relationship?<br> When next we meet together at the central point, even there shall Aditi confirm our brotherhood.<br> 14 The Mothers, Heaven and Earth, those mighty Goddesses, worthy of sacrifice, ecune with the race of Gods.<br> These Two with their support uphold both Gods and men, and with the Fathers pour the copious genial stream.<br> 15 This invocation wins all good that we desire B&#7771;haspati, highly-praised Aramati, are here,<br> Even where the stone that presses meath rings loudly out, and where the sages make their voices heard with hymns.<br> 16 Thus hath the sage, skilled in loud singers' duties, desiring riches, yearning after treasure,<br> Gaya, the priestly singer, with his praises and hymns contented the Celestial people.<br> 17 Thus hath the thoughtful sage the son of Plati, praised you, O Aaiti and all &#256;dityas.<br> Men are made rich by those who are Immortal: the Heavenly Folk have been extolled by Gaya.</p>
