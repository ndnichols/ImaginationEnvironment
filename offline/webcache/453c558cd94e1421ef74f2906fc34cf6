<p>1. LOUD singing at the sacred rite where Soma flows we priests invoke<br> With haste, that he may help, as the bard's Cherisher, Indra who findeth wealth for you.<br> 2. Whom with fair helm, in rapture of the juice, the firm resistless slayers hinder not:<br> Giver of glorious wealth to him who sing a his praise, honouring him who toils and pours:<br> 3 &#346;akra, who like a curry-comb for horses or a golden goad,<br> Indra, the V&#7771;tra-slayer, urges eagerly the opening of the stall of kine:<br> 4 Who for the worshipper scatters forth ample wealth, even though buried, piled in heaps:<br> May Indra, Lord of Bay Steeds, fair-helmed Thunderer, act at his pleasure, as he lists.<br> 5 Hero whom many praise, what thou hast longed for, oven of old, from men.<br> All that we offer unto thee, O Indra, now, sacrifice, laud, effectual speech.<br> 6 To Soma, Much-invoked, Bolt-armed! for thy carouse, Celestial, Soma-drinker come.<br> Thou to the man who- prays and pours the juice hast been best giver of delightful wealth.<br> 7 Here, verily, yesterday we let the Thunder-wielder drink his fill.<br> So in like manner offer him the juice today. Now range you by the Glorious One.<br> 8 Even the wolf, the savage beast that rends the sheep, follows the path of his decrees.<br> So graciously accepting, Indra, this our praise, with wondrous thought come forth to us.<br> 9 What manly deed of vigour now remains that Indra hath not done?<br> Who hath not heard his glorious title and his fame, the V&#7771;tra-slayer from his birth?<br> 10 'How great his power resistless! how invincible the V&#7771;tra-slayer's matchless might!<br> Indra excels all usurers who see the day, excels all traffickers in strength.<br> 11 O Indra, V&#7771;tra-slayer, we, thy very constant worshippers,<br> Bring prayers ne&#146;er heard before to thee, O Much-invoked, O Thunder-armed, to be thy meed.<br> 12 O thou of mighty acts, the aids that are in thee call forward many an eager hope.<br> Past the drink-offerings, Vasu, even of the good, hear my call, Strongest God, and come.<br> 13 Verily, Indra, we are thine, we worshippers depend on thee.<br> For there is none but only thou to show us race, O Maghavan, thou much invoked.<br> 14 From this our misery and famine set us free, from this dire curse deliver us.<br> Succour us with thine help and with thy wondrous thought. Most Mighty, finder of the way.<br> 15 Now let your Soma juice be poured; be not afraid, O Kali's sons.<br> This darkening sorrow goes away; yea, of itself it vanishes.</p>
