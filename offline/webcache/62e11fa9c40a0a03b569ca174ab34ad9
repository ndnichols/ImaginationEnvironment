the year was expired, at the time that kings go out to battle, Joab led forth   
the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and     
came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote        
Rabbah, and destroyed it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found 
it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was  
set upon David's head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the      
city.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And he   
brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and with        
harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the  
children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</P></TD>
