<p>1. LIKE birds who keep their watch, plashing in water, like the loud voices of the thundering rain-cloud,<br> Like merry streamlets bursting from the mountain, thus to B&#7771;haspati our hymns have sounded.<br> 2 The Son of A&#7749;girases, meeting the cattle, as Bhaga, brought in Aryaman among us.<br> As Friend of men he decks the wife and husband: as for the race, B&#7771;haspati, nerve our coursers.<br> 3 B&#7771;haspati, having won them from the mountains, strewed down, like barley out of winnowing- baskets,<br> The vigorous, wandering cows who aid the pious, desired of all, of blameless form, well-coloured.<br> 4 As the Sun dews with meath the seat of Order, and casts a flaming meteor down from heaven.<br> So from the rock B&#7771;haspati forced the cattle, and cleft the earth's skin as it were with water.<br> 5 Forth from mid air with light he dravc the darkness, as the gale blows a lily from the fiver.<br> Like the wind grasping at the cloud of Vala, B&#7771;haspati gathered to himself the cattle,<br> 6 B&#7771;haspati, when he with fiery lightnings cleft through the weapon of reviling Vala,<br> Consumed&#7717;im as tongues cat what teeth have compassed: he threw the prisons of the red cows open.<br> 7 That secret name borne by the lowing cattle within the cave B&#7771;haspati discovered,<br> And drave, himself, the bright kine from the mountain, like a bird's young after the egg's disclosure.<br> 8 He looked around on rock-imprisoned sweetness as one who eyes a fish in scanty water.<br> B&#7771;haspati, cleaving through with varied clamour, brought it forth like a bowl from out the timber.<br> 9 He found the light of heaven, and fire, and Morning: with lucid rays he forced apart the darkness.<br> As from a joint, B&#7771;haspati took the marrow of Vala as he gloried in his cattle.<br> 10 As trees for foliage robbed by winter, Vala mourned for the cows B&#7771;haspati had taken.<br> He did a deed ne&#146;er done, ne&#146;er to be equalled, whereby the Sun and Moon ascend alternate.<br> 11 Like a dark steed adorned with pearl, the Fathers have decorated heaven With constellations.<br> They set the light in day, in night the darkness. B&#7771;haspati cleft the rock and found the cattle.<br> 12 This homage have we.offered to the Cloud God who thunders out to many in succession.<br> May this B&#7771;haspati vouchsafe us fulness of life with kine and horses, men, and heroes.</p>
