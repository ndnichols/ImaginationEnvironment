Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul 
stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>I think myself happy, king Agrippa, 
because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things  
whereof I am accused of the Jews:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3>   
<H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Especially because I know thee to be expert in all        
customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to     
hear me patiently.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own   
nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Which knew me from the beginning, if they would   
testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a           
Pharisee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of ELOHIYM, unto our 
fathers:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Unto  
which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving day and night, hope to come. 
For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Why should it be thought a      
thing incredible with you, that ELOHIYM should raise the dead?</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>I verily thought with myself,   
that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of YAHSHUA of Nazareth.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Which thing I   
also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having   
received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I   
gave my voice against them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>    
11</H4></TD><TD><P>And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled    
them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them    
even unto strange cities.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>      
12</H4></TD><TD><P>Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and           
commission from the chief priests,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13> 
<H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, 
above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which          
journeyed with me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto  
me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is 
hard for thee to kick against the pricks.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And I said, Who art thou, ADOWN? And he said, I 
am YAHSHUA whom thou persecutest.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16>  
<H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared   
unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these 
things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear     
unto thee;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send    
thee,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>To     
open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of 
Satan unto ELOHIYM, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance  
among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was  
not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at  
Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles,   
that they should repent and turn to ELOHIYM, and do works meet for              
repentance.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P> 
For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill       
me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Having   
therefore obtained help of ELOHIYM, I continue unto this day, witnessing both   
to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and  
Moses did say should come:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>     
23</H4></TD><TD><P>That MASHIYACH should suffer, and that he should be the      
first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people,    
and to the Gentiles.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice,    
Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>But he said, I am not     
mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>For the king    
knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded    
that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a 
corner.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>King 
Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Agrippa said unto    
Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a MASHIYACHian.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And Paul said, I would to EL,     
that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and   
altogether such as I am, except these bonds.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up,  
and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they were gone       
aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of 
death or of bonds.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty,  
if he had not appealed unto Caesar.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
