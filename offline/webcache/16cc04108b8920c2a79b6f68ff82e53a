</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover,         
brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of ELOHIYM bestowed on the churches of  
Macedonia;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>How 
that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep   
poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>For to their power, I bear record,  
yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves;</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Praying us with much intreaty   
that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the          
ministering to the saints.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves 
to YHVH, and unto us by the will of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had    
begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore, as ye abound in every    
thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in     
your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>I speak not by commandment, but by  
occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your       
love.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>For ye   
know the grace of our ADONAY YAHSHUA MASHIYACH, that, though he was rich, yet   
for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And herein I    
give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only  
to do, but also to be forward a year ago.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as  
there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that   
which ye have.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man 
hath, and not according to that he hath not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye  
burdened:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>   
But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for    
their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there 
may be equality:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he     
that had gathered little had no lack.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>But thanks be to ELOHIYM, which put the same    
earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but  
being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And we have sent with him the     
brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And not that only,   
but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace,      
which is administered by us to the glory of the same YHVH, and declaration of   
your ready mind:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is    
administered by us:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of YHVH, but also in  
the sight of men.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved   
diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence  
which I have in you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper  
concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers of the  
churches, and the glory of MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the       
churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.</P></TD>
