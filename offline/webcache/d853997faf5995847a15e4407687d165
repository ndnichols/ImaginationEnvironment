<p>1. To him, Vai&#347;v&#257;nara, who strengthens Holy Law, to Agni we present our praise like oil made pure.<br> With thoughtful insight human priests bring him anear, our Herald from of old, as an axe forms a car.<br> 2 He made the heaven and earth resplendent by his birth: Child of two Mothers he was meet to be implored,<br> Agni, oblation-bearer, gracious, ever-young, infallible, rich in radiant light, the guest of men.<br> 3 Within the range of their surpassinq power, by might, the Gods created Agni with inventive thought.<br> I, eager to win strength, address him, like a steed, resplendent with his brilliance, with his ample light.<br> 4 Eager to gain, we crave from him the friendly God strength confident, choiceworthy meet to be extolled:<br> The Bh&#7771;gus' bounty, willing, strong with sages' lore, even Agni shining forth with light that comes from heaven.<br> 5 For happiness, men, having trimmed the sacred grass, set Agni glorious for his strength before them here;<br> Yea, with raised ladles, him bright, dear to all the Gods, perfecting aims of works, Rudra of solemn rites.<br> 6 Around thy dwelling-place, O brightly-shining Priest, are men at sacrifice, whose sacred grass is trimmed.<br> Wishing to do thee service, Agni, they are there, desirous of thy friendship grant them store of wealth.<br> 7 He hath filled heaven and earth and the great realm of light, when at his birth the skilful held him in their hold.<br> He like a horse is led forth to the sacrifice Sage, graciously inclined, that he may win us strength.<br> 8 Honour the oblation-bearer, him who knows fair rites, serve ye the Household Friend who knows all things that be.<br> He drives the chariot of the lofty ordinance: Agni most active, is the great High Priest of Gods.<br> 9 They who are free from death, fain for him, purified three splendours of the mighty Agni, circling all.<br> To man, for his enjoyment, one of these they gave: the other two have passed into the sister sphere.<br> 10 Man's sacrificial food hath sharpened like an axe, for brightness, him the Sage of men, the people's Lord,<br> Busied with sacred rites he mounts and he descends. He hath laid down his vital germ within these worlds.<br> 11 He stirs with life in wombs dissimilar in kind, born as a Lion or a loudly-bellowing Bull:<br> Vai&#347;v&#257;nara immortal with wide-reaching might, bestowing goods and wealth on him who offiers gifts.<br> 12 Vai&#347;v&#257;nara, as of old, mounted the cope of heaven, heaven's ridge, well greeted, by those skilled in noble songs.<br> He, as of old, producing riches for the folk, still watchful, traversesthe common way again.<br> 13 For new prosperity we seek to Agni, him whose course is splendid, gold-haired, excellently bright,<br> Whom M&#257;tari&#347;van stablished, dweller in the heaven, meet for high praise and holy, sage and true to Law.<br> 14 As pure and swift of course, beholder of the light, who stands in heaven's bright sphere a sign, who wakes at dawn,<br> Agni, the head of heaven, whom none may turn aside-to him the Powerful with mighty prayer we seek.<br> 15 The cheerful Priest, the pure, in whom no guile is found, Friend of the House, praise-worthy, dear to all mankind,<br> Fair to behold for beauty like a splendid car,&#151;Agni the Friend of men we ever seek for wealth.</p>
