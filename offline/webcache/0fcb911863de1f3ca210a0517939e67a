<TD><P>Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will 
come: but woe unto him, through whom they come!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>It were better for him that a millstone were   
hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one 
of these little ones.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke    
him; and if he repent, forgive him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4> 
<H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and 
seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive   
him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And the   
apostles said unto the ADONAY, Increase our faith.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And the ADONAY said, If ye had      
faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou 
plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey      
you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>But which 
of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and    
by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And will not rather say unto    
him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I     
have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Doth he thank that servant  
because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>So likewise ye, when ye shall 
have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable    
servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, as he went   
to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And as he entered    
into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood     
afar off:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And they lifted up their voices, and said, YAHSHUA, Master, have mercy on       
us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And when 
he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it     
came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And one of them, when he saw that 
he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified ELOHIYM,</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And fell down on his 
face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA answering said,   
Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>There are not found that returned 
to give glory to ELOHIYM, save this stranger.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy 
faith hath made thee whole.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>    
20</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom  
of EL should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of EL cometh not with 
observation:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>
Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of EL   
is within you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to  
see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And they shall say to     
you, See here; or, see there: go not after them, nor follow them.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>For as the lightning,     
that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven, shineth unto the other part   
under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>But first must he suffer many     
things, and be rejected of this generation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it   
be also in the days of the Son of man.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>They did eat, they drank, they married wives,   
they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and   
the flood came, and destroyed them all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot;     
they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they            
builded;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>But 
the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from       
heaven, and destroyed them all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>
30</H4></TD><TD><P>Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is      
revealed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>In 
that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let  
him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him         
likewise not return back.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>      
32</H4></TD><TD><P>Remember Lot's wife.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>I tell you, in that night     
there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall  
be left.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>Two 
women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other         
left.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>Two    
men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And they answered    
and said unto him, Where, ADONAY? And he said unto them, Wheresoever the body   
is, thither will the eagles be gathered together.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This
