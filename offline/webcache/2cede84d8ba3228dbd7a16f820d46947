<p>1. WE, Indra, Lord of ample wealth, our Guide, depend on one like thee,<br> Thou driver of the Tawny Steeds.<br> 2 For, Hurler of the Bolt, we know thee true, the giver of our food,<br> We know the giver of our wealth.<br> 3 O thou whose majesty the bards celebrate with their songs, thou Lord,<br> Of hundred powers and hundred aids.<br> 4 Fair guidance hath the mortal man whom Aryaman, the Marut host,<br> And Mitra, void of guile, protect.<br> 5 Kine, steeds, and hero strength he gains, and prospers, by the &#256;dityas sped,<br> Ever in wealth which all desire.<br> 6 We pray to Indra for his gift, to him the Fearless and the Strong,<br> We pray to him the Lord of wealth.<br> 7 For verily combined in him are all the fearless powers of aid.<br> Him, rich in wealth, let swift Steeds bring to us, his Bays, to Soma juice for his carouse:<br> 8 Yea, that most excellent carouse, Indra, which slays most enemies,<br> With Heroes wins the light of heaven, and is invincible in war:<br> 9 Which merits fame, all-bountiful! and, unsubdued, hath victory in deeds of might.<br> So come to our libations, Strongest! Excellent! May we obtain a stall of kine.<br> 10 Responding to our wish for cows, for steeds, and chariots, as of old,<br> Be gracious, Greatest of the Great<br> 11 For, Hero, nowhere can I find the bounds of thy munificence.<br> Still do thou favour us, O Bolt-armed Maghavan: with strength hast thou rewarded hymns.<br> 12 High, glorifier of his friend, he knows all generations, he whom many praise.<br> All races of mankind with ladies lifted up invoke that Mighty Indra's aid.<br> 13 Be he our Champion and Protector in great deeds, rich in all wealth, the V&#7771;tra-slayer, Maghavan.<br> 14 In the wild raptures of the juice sing to your Hero with high laud, to him the Wise,<br> To Indra, glorious in his name, the Mighty One, even as the hymn alloweth it.<br> 15 Thou givest wealth to me myself, thou givest treasure, Excellent! and the strong steed,<br> O Much-invoked, in deeds of might, yea, even now.<br> 16 Him, Sovran Ruler of all precious things, who even hath power o&#146;er this fair form of his,<br> As now it taketh shape, and afterward,<br> 17 We praise, so that the Mighty One may speed to you, Pourer of <A HREF="errata.htm#22">bounties</A>, Traveller, prepared to go.<br> Thou favourest the Maruts known to all, by song and sacrifice.<br> With song and praise I sing to thee.<br> 18 We in the sacrifice perform their will whose voice is lifted high,<br> The worship of those Thundering Ones who o&#146;er the ridges of these mountains fly in troops.<br> 19 O Indra, Mightiest, bring us that which crushes men of evil minds,<br> Wealth suited to our needs, O Stirrer of the thought, best wealth, O thou who stirrest thought.<br> 20 O Winner, noble winner, strong, wondrous, most splendid, excellent,<br> Sole Lord of victory, bring all-overpowering wealth, joy-giving, chief in deeds of might.<br> 21 Now let the godless man approach who hath received reward so great<br> As Va&#347;a, A&#347;vya, when this light of morning dawned, received from P&#7771;thu&#347;ravas, from Kan&#299;ta's son.<br> 22 Steeds sixty thousand and ten thousand kine, and twenty hundred camels I obtained;<br> Ten hundred brown in hue, and other ten red in three spots: in all, ten thousand kine.<br> 23 Ten browns that make my wealth increase, fleet steeds whose tails are long and fair,<br> Turn with swift whirl my chariot wheel;<br> 24 The gifts which P&#7771;thu&#347;ravas gave, Kan&#299;ta's son munificent.<br> He gave a chariot wrought of gold: the prince was passing bountiful, and won himself most lofty fame.<br> 25 Come thou to this great rite of ours, V&#257;yu! to give us vigorous light.<br> We have served thee that thou mightest give much to us, yea, mightest quickly give great wealth.<br> 26 Who with thrice seven times seventy horses comes to us, invested with the rays of morn,<br> Through these our Soma-draughts and those who press, to give, drinker of pure bright Soma Juice.<br> 27 Who hath inclined this glorious one, bounteous himself, to give me gifts.<br> Borne on firm chariot with the prosperous Nahu&#7779;a, wise, to a man yet more devout.<br> 28 Sole Lord in beauty meet for praise, O V&#257;yu, dropping fatness down,<br> Hurried along by steeds, by camels, and by hounds, spreads forth thy train: even this it is.<br> 29 So, as a prize dear to the strong, the sixty thousand have I gained,<br> Bulls that resemble vigorous steeds.<br> 30 To me come oxen like a herd, yea, unto me the oxen come.<br> 31 And in the grazing herd he made a hundred camels bleat for me,<br> And twenty hundred mid the white.<br> 32 A hundred has the sage received, D&#257;sa Balb&#363;tha's and Taruk&#7779;a's gifts.<br> These are thy people, V&#257;yu, who rejoice with Indra for their guard, rejoice with Gods for guards.<br> 33 And now to Va&#347;a A&#347;vya here this stately woman is led forth,<br> Adorned with ornaments of gold.</p>
