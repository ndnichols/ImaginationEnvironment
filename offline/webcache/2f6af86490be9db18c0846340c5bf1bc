<TD><P>And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings  
go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all    
Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But      
David tarried still at Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2>   
<H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose   
from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and from the    
roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look   
upon.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And      
David sent and inquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bathsheba,   
the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And David sent messengers, and took 
her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from   
her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And the woman conceived, and sent   
and told David, and said, I am with child.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the 
Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded  
of him how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And David said to      
Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the   
king's house, and there followed him a mess of meat from the king.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>But Uriah slept at the door 
of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his 
house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David     
said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy journey? why then didst thou not go   
down unto thine house?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in 
tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open  
fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with   
my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And David said  
to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I will let thee depart. So      
Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And when David had called him, he 
did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to 
lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his          
house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it  
by the hand of Uriah.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront   
of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and      
die.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And it  
came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place  
where he knew that valiant men were.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And the men of the city went out, and fought    
with Joab: and there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and      
Uriah the Hittite died also.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>   
18</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the  
war;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And     
charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling the        
matters of the war unto the king,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20>  
<H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say     
unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight?     
knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Who smote Abimelech the son of    
Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the     
wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy     
servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>So the messenger went, and came and showed      
David all that Joab had sent him for.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And the messenger said unto David, Surely the   
men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon 
them even unto the entering of the gate.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And the shooters shot from off the wall upon    
thy servants; and some of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah    
the Hittite is dead also.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>      
25</H4></TD><TD><P>Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto 
Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as 
another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and    
encourage thou him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she    
mourned for her husband.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his   
house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David    
had done displeased YHVH.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright
