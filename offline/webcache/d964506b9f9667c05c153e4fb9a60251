<p>1. FAR-SHINING, widely famed, going thy wonted way, fed with the oil, be helpful. Mitra-like, to us.<br> So, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, e&#146;en the wise must swell thy song of praise, and he who hath oblations pay thee solemn rites.<br> 2 He who brings gifts to him the Ancient and the Last, to Vi&#7779;&#7751;u who ordains, together with his Spouse,<br> Who tells the lofty birth of him the Lofty One, shall verily surpass in glory e&#146;en his peer.<br> 3 Him have ye satisfied, singers, as well as ye know, primeval germ of Order even from his birth.<br> Ye, knowing e&#146;en his name, have told it forth: may we, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, enjoy the grace of thee the Mighty One.<br> 4 The Sovran Varu&#7751;a and both the A&#347;vins wait on this the will of him who guides the Marut host.<br> Vi&#7779;&#7751;u hath power supreme and might that finds the day, and with his Friend unbars the stable of the kine.<br> 5 Even he the Heavenly One who came for fellowship, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u to Indra, godly to the godlier,<br> Who Maker, throned in three worlds, helps the &#256;ryan man, and gives the worshipper his share of Holy Law.</p>
