Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer,      
being the ninth hour.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they     
laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of  
them that entered into the temple;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3>  
<H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple     
asked an alms.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>
And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And he gave heed unto  
them, expecting to receive something of them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none;  
but such as I have give I thee: In the name of YAHSHUA MASHIYACH of Nazareth    
rise up and walk.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his    
feet and ankle bones received strength.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered  
with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising ELOHIYM.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And all the people saw 
him walking and praising ELOHIYM:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10>  
<H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the   
Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at 
that which had happened unto him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11>  
<H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and      
John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called         
Solomon's, greatly wondering.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>  
12</H4></TD><TD><P>And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men   
of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though  
by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>The ELOHIYM of Abraham, and of    
Isaac, and of Jacob, the EL of our fathers, hath glorified his Son YAHSHUA;     
whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was     
determined to let him go.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>      
14</H4></TD><TD><P>But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a       
murderer to be granted unto you;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15>   
<H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And killed the Prince of life, whom ELOHIYM hath raised  
from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And his name through faith in his name hath     
made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath 
given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And now, brethren, I wot that 
through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>But those things, which ELOHIYM   
before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that MASHIYACH should       
suffer, he hath so fulfilled.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>  
19</H4></TD><TD><P>Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be 
blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of       
YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And he 
shall send YAHSHUA MASHIYACH, which before was preached unto you:</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Whom the heaven must      
receive until the times of restitution of all things, which ELOHIYM hath spoken 
by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>For Moses truly said unto the 
fathers, A prophet shall YHVH your ELOHIYM raise up unto you of your brethren,  
like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto      
you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And it  
shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be 
destroyed from among the people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24>   
<H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that     
follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye are the      
children of the prophets, and of the covenant which ELOHIYM made with our       
fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the     
earth be blessed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Unto you first YHVH, having raised up his Son YAHSHUA, sent him to bless 
you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
