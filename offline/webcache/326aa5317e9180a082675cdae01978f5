<p>1. WHO will hear, who of those who merit worship, which of all Gods take pleasure in our homage?<br> On whose heart shall we lay this laud celestial, rich with fair offerings, dearest to Immortals?<br> 2 Who will be gracious? Who will come most quickly of all the Gods? Who will<br> bring bliss most largely?<br> What car do they call swift with rapid coursers? That which the Daughter of the Sun elected.<br> 3 So many days do ye come swiftly hither, as Indra to give help in stress of battle.<br> Descended from the sky, divine, strong-pinioned, by which of all your powers are ye most mighty?<br> 4 What is the prayer that we should bring you, A&#347;vins, whereby ye come to us when invocated?<br> Whether of you confronts e&#146;en great betrayal? Lovers of sweetness, Dasras, help and save us.<br> 5 In the wide space your chariot reacheth heaven, what time it turneth hither from the ocean.<br> Sweets from your sweet shall drop, lovers of sweetness! These have they dressed for you as dainty viands.<br> 6 Let Sindhu with his wave bedew your horses: in fiery glow have the red birds come hither.<br> Observed of all was that your rapid going, whereby ye were the Lords of S&#363;rya's Daughter.<br> 7 Whene&#146;er I gratified you here together, your grace was given us, O ye rich in booty.<br> Protect, ye Twain, the singer of your praises: to you, N&#257;satyas, is my wish directed.</p>
