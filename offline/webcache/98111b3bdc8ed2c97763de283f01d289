<TD><P>And YHVH sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto     
him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>The rich man had       
exceeding many flocks and herds:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>
3</H4></TD><TD><P>But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which 
he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his  
children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his  
bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And there came a traveler unto the rich man, and  
he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the        
wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed 
it for the man that was come to him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5>
<H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man;    
and he said to Nathan, As YHVH liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall  
surely die:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because  
he had no pity.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith YHVH ELOHIYM of       
Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand  
of Saul;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And I 
gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave   
thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would 
moreover have given unto thee such and such things.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore hast thou despised the    
commandment of YHVH, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the        
Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain  
him with the sword of the children of Ammon.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Now therefore the sword shall never depart from 
thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah    
the Hittite to be thy wife.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>    
11</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus saith YHVH, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee   
out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give   
them unto thy neighbor, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this    
sun.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>For     
thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before  
the sun.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against YHVH. And Nathan said unto David, 
YHVH also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Howbeit, because by this deed     
thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of YHVH to blaspheme, the child   
also that is born unto thee shall surely die.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And Nathan departed unto his house. And YHVH 
struck the child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>David therefore 
besought ELOHIYM for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all      
night upon the earth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up 
from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass  
on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to    
tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was    
yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will 
he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>But when David saw that his   
servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David    
said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Then David arose     
from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and  
came into the house of YHVH, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and 
when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said his servants unto   
him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the   
child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat 
bread.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can  
tell whether YHVH will be gracious to me, that the child may live?</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>But now he is dead,       
wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he  
shall not return to me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and   
lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and YHVH      
loved him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, 
because of YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the    
royal city.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and  
have taken the city of waters.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4> 
28</H4></TD><TD><P>Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and    
encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called    
after my name.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought   
against it, and took it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight        
whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on        
David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And he brought  
forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows  
of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and 
thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the  
people returned unto Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
