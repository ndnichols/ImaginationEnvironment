<TD><P>When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was        
discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the   
thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers spoileth without.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And they consider not in their  
hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset    
them about; they are before my face.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3>
<H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the    
princes with their lies.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who        
ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>In the day of our 
king the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his  
hand with scorners.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in    
wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a        
flaming fire.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P> 
They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings    
are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Ephraim, he hath mixed himself      
among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Strangers have devoured his strength, and he   
knoweth it not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth     
not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And the 
pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to YHVH their    
ELOHIYM, nor seek him for all this.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11>
<H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they    
call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12> 
<H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I    
will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their 
congregation hath heard.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them!   
because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet     
they have spoken lies against me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14>  
<H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when   
they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, and    
they rebel against me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they        
imagine mischief against me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>   
16</H4></TD><TD><P>They return, but not to the ELYOWN: they are like a          
deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their      
tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
