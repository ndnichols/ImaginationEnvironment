baptism,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>One   
ELOHIYM and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you

Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of ELOHIYM

heart:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Who

devil.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Let   
him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands
