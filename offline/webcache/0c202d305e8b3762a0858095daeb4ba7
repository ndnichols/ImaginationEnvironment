1</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with        
ELOHIYM through our ADONAY YAHSHUA MASHIYACH:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>By whom also we have access by faith into this 
grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of ELOHIYM.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And not only so, but   
we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And patience,     
experience; and experience, hope:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5>   
<H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of ELOHIYM  
is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>For when we were yet   
without strength, in due time MASHIYACH died for the ungodly.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>For scarcely for a righteous    
man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to       
die.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>But       
ELOHIYM commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners,      
MASHIYACH died for us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved 
from wrath through him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to ELOHIYM by the  
death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his         
life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
not only so, but we also joy in ELOHIYM through our ADONAY YAHSHUA MASHIYACH,   
by whom we have now received the atonement.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the   
world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have    
sinned:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>(For 
until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no     
law.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>        
Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not      
sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him   
that was to come.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the     
offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of ELOHIYM, and the gift by    
grace, which is by one man, YAHSHUA MASHIYACH, hath abounded unto many.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And not as it was by 
one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation,   
but the free gift is of many offences unto justification.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>For if by one man's offence death 
reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift 
of righteousness shall reign in life by one, YAHSHUA MASHIYACH.)</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore as by the       
offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the       
righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of      
life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>For as 
by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one    
shall many be made righteous.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>  
20</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But 
where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so 
might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by YAHSHUA MASHIYACH  
our ADONAY.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M.
