<p>1. FULL Many songs have met in thee, O Indra, and many a noble thought from thee proceedeth.<br> Now and of old the eulogies of sages, their holy hymns and lauds, have yearned for Indra.<br> 2 He, praised of many, bold, invoked of many, alone is glorified at sacrifices.<br> Like a car harnessed for some great achievement, Indra must be the cause of our rejoicing.<br> 3 They make their way to Indra and exalt him, bim whom no prayers and no laudations trouble;<br> For when a hundred or a thousand singers. laud him who loves the song their praise delights him.<br> 4 As brightness mingles with the Moon in heaven, the offered Soma yearns to mix with Indra.<br> Like water brought to men in desert places, our gifts at sacrifice have still refreshed him.<br> 5 To him this mighty eulogy, to Indra hath this our laud been uttered by the poets,<br> That in the great encounter with the foemen, Loved of all life, Indra may guard and help us.</p>
