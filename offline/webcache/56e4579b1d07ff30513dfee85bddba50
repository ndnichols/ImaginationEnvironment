Chapter 9</H1></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and   
said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box of oil in thine hand, and   
go to Ramothgilead:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat 
the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren,    
and carry him to an inner chamber;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3>  
<H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head, and    
say, Thus saith YHVH, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then open the      
door, and flee, and tarry not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>  
4</H4></TD><TD><P>So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to     
Ramothgilead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I 
have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which of all us? And he  
said, To thee, O captain.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his 
head, and said unto him, Thus saith YHVH ELOHIYM of Israel, I have anointed     
thee king over the people of YHVH, even over Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And thou shalt smite the house of   
Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and   
the blood of all the servants of YHVH, at the hand of Jezebel.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>For the whole house of Ahab     
shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall,   
and him that is shut up and left in Israel:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will make the house of Ahab like the house  
of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of           
Ahijah:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none   
to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his  
lord: and one said unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to     
thee? And he said unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And they said, It is 
false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus     
saith YHVH, I have anointed thee king over Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Then they hasted, and took every  
man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with   
trumpets, saying, Jehu is king.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>
14</H4></TD><TD><P>So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired   
against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, he and all Israel, because of  
Hazael king of Syria.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds   
which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And 
Jehu said, If it be your minds, then let none go forth nor escape out of the    
city to go to tell it in Jezreel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16>  
<H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for      
Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And there stood a    
watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came,  
and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet   
them, and let him say, Is it peace?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18>
<H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said,    
Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with      
peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came   
to them, but he cometh not again.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19>  
<H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to    
them, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast  
thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And the watchman told, saying, He came even     
unto them, and cometh not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu    
the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was 
made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each   
in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of   
Naboth the Jezreelite.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it       
peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy       
mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and    
said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength,  
and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he 
sunk down in his chariot.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>      
25</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him  
in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that,    
when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, YHVH laid this burden upon 
him;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>Surely  
I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith     
YHVH; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith YHVH. Now therefore take and  
cast him into the plat of ground, according to the word of YHVH.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>But when Ahaziah the king 
of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed    
after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the      
going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And his         
servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre 
with his fathers in the city of David.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of    
Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel      
heard of it; and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a  
window.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who slew his         
master?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? who? And      
there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, Throw her down. So they threw   
her down: and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses:   
and he trode her under foot.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>   
34</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, 
see now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king's daughter.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And they went to     
bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the   
palms of her hands.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the word   
of YHVH, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the      
portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And the carcass of Jezebel shall  
be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they   
shall not say, This is Jezebel.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
