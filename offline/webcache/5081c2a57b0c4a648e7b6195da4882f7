<TD><P>Now the word of YHVH came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Arise, go to Nineveh,  
that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before     
me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>But Jonah  
rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of YHVH, and went down to       
Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and  
went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of YHVH.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>But YHVH sent out 
a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that   
the ship was like to be broken.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4> 
5</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his   
god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it 
of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and    
was fast asleep.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O       
sleeper? arise, call upon thy ELOHIYM, if so be that will think upon us, that   
we perish not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>
And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may  
know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell  
upon Jonah.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is    
upon us; What is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? 
and of what people art thou?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>    
9</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear YHVH, the   
ELOHIYM of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Then were the men exceedingly 
afraid, and said unto him. Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he    
fled from the presence of YHVH, because he had told them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said they unto him, What     
shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought,   
and was tempestuous.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea;  
so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great       
tempest is upon you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they   
could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore they cried unto 
YHVH, and said, We beseech thee, O YHVH, we beseech thee, let us not perish for 
this man's life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O YHVH, hast     
done as it pleased thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4>
</TD><TD><P>So they look up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea 
ceased from her raging.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>Then the men feared YHVH exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto  
YHVH, and made vows.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Now YHVH had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah   
was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
