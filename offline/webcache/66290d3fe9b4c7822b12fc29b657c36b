<p>1. THAT gift of ours which Indra loves and welcomes, even that he makes for us, the Great and Strong One.<br> He who comes wielding in his might the thunder, Maghavan, gives prayer, praise, and laud, and Soma.<br> 2 Bull, hurler of the four-edged rain-producer with both his arms, strong, mighty, most heroic;<br> Wearing as wool Paru&#7779;&#7751;&#299; for adornment, whose joints for sake of friendship he hath covered.<br> 3 God who of all the Gods was born divinest, endowed with ample strength and mighty powers,<br> And bearing in his arms the yearning thunder, with violent rush caused heaven and earth to tremble.<br> 4 Before the High God, at his birth, heaven trembled, earth, many floods and all the precipices.<br> The Strong One bringeth nigh the Bull's two Parents: loud sing the winds, like men, in air's mid-region.<br> 5 These are thy great deeds, Indra, thine, the Mighty, deeds to be told aloud at all libations,<br> That thou, O Hero, bold and boldly daring, didst with thy bolt, by strength, destroy the Dragon.<br> 6 True are all these thy deeds, O Most Heroic. The Milch-kine issued from the streaming udder.<br> In fear of thee, O thou of manly spirit, the rivers swiftly set themselves in motion.<br> 7 With joy, O Indra, Lord of Tawny Coursers, the Sisters then, these Goddesses, extolled thee,<br> When thou didst give the prisoned ones their freedom to wander at their will in long succession.<br> 8 Pressed is the gladdening stalk as &#146;twere a river: so let the rite, the toiler's power, attract thee<br> To us-ward, of the Bright One, as the courser strains his. exceedingly strong leather bridle.<br> 9 Ever by us perform thy most heroic, thine highest, best victorious deeds, O Victor.<br> For us make V&#7771;tras easy to be conquered: destroy the weapon of our mortal foeman.<br> 10 Graciously listen to our prayer, O Indra, and strength of varied sort bestow thou on us.<br> Send to us all intelligence arid wisdom O Maghavan, be he who gives us cattle.<br> 11 Now, Indra! lauded, glorified with praises, let wealth swell high like rivers to the singer.<br> For thee a new hymn, Lord of Bays, is fashioned. May we, car-borne, through song be victors ever.</p>
