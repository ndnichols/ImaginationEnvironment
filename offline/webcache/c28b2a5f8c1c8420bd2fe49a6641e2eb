<p>1. To thee will send praise and bring oblation, as thou hast merited lauds when we invoked thee.<br> A fountain in the desert art thou, Agni, O Ancient King, to man who fain would worship,<br> 2 Thou unto whom resort the gathered people, as the kine seek the warm stall, O Most Youthful.<br> Thou art the messenger of Gods and mortals, and goest glorious with thy light between them.<br> 3 Making thee grow as &#146;twere some noble infant, thy Mother nurtures thee with sweet affection.<br> Over the desert slopes thou passest longing, and seekest, like some beast set free, thy fodder.<br> 4 Foolish are we, O Wise and free from error: verily, Agni, thou dost know thy grandeur.<br> There lies the form: he moves and licks, and swallows, and, as House-Lord, kisses the Youthful Maiden.<br> 5 He rises ever fresh in ancient fuel: smoke-bannered, gray, he makes the wood his dwelling.<br> No swimmer, Steer, he presses through the waters, and to his place accordant mortals bear him.<br> 6 Like thieves who risk their lives and haunt the forest, the twain with their ten girdles have secured him.<br> This is a new hymn meant for thee, O Agni: yoke as it were thy car with parts that glitter.<br> 7 Homage and prayer are thine, O J&#257;tavedas, and this my song shall evermore exalt thee.<br> Agni, protect our children and descendants, and guard with ever-watcliful care our bodies.</p>
