Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, 
any of you should seem to come short of it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as   
unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with      
faith in them that heard it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>    
3</H4></TD><TD><P>For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As 
I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works  
were finished from the foundation of the world.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>For he spake in a certain place of the seventh 
day on this wise, And ELOHIYM did rest the seventh day from all his works.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And in this place 
again, If they shall enter into my rest.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must      
enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of 
unbelief:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>     
Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a      
time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your          
hearts.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>For if 
Joshua had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another  
day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>There     
remaineth therefore a rest to the people of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>For he that is entered into his   
rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as ELOHIYM did from his.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Let us labour        
therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of  
unbelief.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>   
For the word of ELOHIYM is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged   
sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the     
joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the        
heart.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>      
Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things 
are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Seeing then that we have  
a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, YAHSHUA the Son of        
ELOHIYM, let us hold fast our profession.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>For we have not an high priest which cannot be  
touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like 
as we are, yet without sin.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>    
16</H4></TD><TD><P>Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that  
we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</P></TD></TR>
