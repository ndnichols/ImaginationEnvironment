There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band   
called the Italian band,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>A devout man, and one that feared ELOHIYM with all his house, which 
gave much alms to the people, and prayed to EL alway.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>He saw in a vision evidently about  
the ninth hour of the day an angel of ELOHIYM coming in to him, and saying unto 
him, Cornelius.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, YHVH? And he 
said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before     
EL.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And now    
send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter:</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>He lodgeth with one Simon a 
tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest   
to do.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And     
when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his    
household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him             
continually;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>On the morrow, as 
they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the 
housetop to pray about the sixth hour:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And he became very hungry, and would have       
eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And saw heaven opened, and a      
certain vessel descending upon him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the    
four corners, and let down to the earth:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of 
the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And there came a     
voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>But Peter said, Not so, YHVH; for I have never  
eaten any thing that is common or unclean.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And the voice spake unto him again the second   
time, What ELOHIYM hath cleansed, that call not thou common.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>This was done thrice: and the 
vessel was received up again into heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Now while Peter doubted in himself what this    
vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from      
Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate,</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And called, and 
asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>While Peter thought on    
the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Arise therefore, and get  
thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Peter went down 
to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he   
whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And they said, Cornelius the      
centurion, a just man, and one that feareth ELOHIYM, and of good report among   
all the nation of the Jews, was warned from EL by an holy angel to send for     
thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Then called he them in, and lodged them. And 
on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa        
accompanied him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited    
for them, and he had called together his kinsmen and near friends.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And as Peter was coming   
in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>But Peter took him   
up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And as he talked with him, he went in, and   
found many that were come together.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28>
<H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an         
unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of     
another nation; but ELOHIYM hath shewed me that I should not call any man       
common or unclean.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: 
I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And Cornelius said, Four days ago 
I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, 
behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And said, Cornelius, thy prayer   
is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of ELOHIYM.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>Send therefore  
to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the    
house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak   
unto thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art     
come. Now therefore are we all here present before ELOHIYM, to hear all things  
that are commanded thee of EL.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4> 
34</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive 
that ELOHIYM is no respecter of persons:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>But in every nation he that feareth him, and    
worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>The word which was sent unto the children of    
Israel, preaching peace by YAHSHUA MASHIYACH: (he is ADONAY of all:)</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>That word, I say, ye 
know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after  
the baptism which John preached;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38>   
<H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>How ELOHIYM anointed YAHSHUA of Nazareth with the Holy   
Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were      
oppressed of the devil; for EL was with him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>And we are witnesses of all things which he did 
both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a  
tree:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>Him    
ELOHIYM raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>Not to all the people, but unto   
witnesses chosen before EL, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he 
rose from the dead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is 
he which was ordained of ELOHIYM to be the Judge of quick and dead.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>To him give all the  
prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall        
receive remission of sins.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>     
44</H4></TD><TD><P>While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on    
all them which heard the word.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45><H4> 
45</H4></TD><TD><P>And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, 
as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out    
the gift of the Holy Ghost.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46><H4>    
46</H4></TD><TD><P>For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify ELOHIYM. 
Then answered Peter,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>47</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which  
have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V48><H4>48</H4></TD><TD><P>And he commanded them to be baptized in the     
name of the ADONAY. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.</P></TD></TR>
