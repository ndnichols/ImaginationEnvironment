1</H4></TD><TD><P>What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of  
circumcision?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of   
YAH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>For what  
if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of ELOHIYM without 
effect?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>       
Forbid: yea, let ELOHIYM be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That  
thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art  
judged.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>But if 
our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of ELOHIYM, what shall we say? Is 
EL unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Forbid: for then how shall ELOHIYM  
judge the world?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>For if the truth of ELOHIYM hath more abounded through my lie unto his       
glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported,  
and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose      
damnation is just.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before   
proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>As it is written, There is    
none righteous, no, not one:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>   
11</H4></TD><TD><P>There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh 
after ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable;     
there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their   
tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Whose mouth is full  
of cursing and bitterness:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>     
15</H4></TD><TD><P>Their feet are swift to shed blood:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Destruction and misery are in     
their ways:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And the way of peace have they not known:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>There is no fear of YHVH before their eyes.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Now we know     
that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law:  
that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before     
ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his      
sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>But now the righteousness of ELOHIYM without 
the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Even the             
righteousness of ELOHIYM which is by faith of YAHSHUA MASHIYACH unto all and    
upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>For all have sinned, and come     
short of the glory of ELOHIYM;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4> 
24</H4></TD><TD><P>Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption   
that is in MASHIYACH YAHSHUA:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>  
25</H4></TD><TD><P>Whom ELOHIYM hath set forth to be a propitiation through     
faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that 
are past, through the forbearance of EL;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>To declare, I say, at this time his             
righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth  
in YAHSHUA.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the  
law of faith.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of  
the law.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Is  
he the EL of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the         
Gentiles also:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>Seeing it is one EL, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and      
uncircumcision through faith.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>  
31</H4></TD><TD><P>Do we then make void the law through faith? Forbid: yea, we  
establish the law.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by
