<p>1. GREAT, hero-like controlling men is Indra, unwasting in his powers, doubled in vastness.<br> He, turned to us, hath grown to hero vigour: broad, wide, he hath been decked by those who serve him.<br> 2 The bowl made Indra swift to gather booty, the High, the Lofty, Youthful, Undecaying,<br> Him who hath waxed by strength which none may conquer, and even at once grown to complete perfection.<br> 3 Stretch out those hands of thine, extend to us-ward thy wide capacious arms, and grant us glory.<br> Like as the household herdsman guards the cattle, so move thou round about us in the combat.<br> 4 Now, fain for strength, let us invite your Indra hither, who lieth hidden with his Heroes,&#151;<br> Free from all blame, without reproach, uninjured, e&#146;en as were those who sang, of old, his praises.<br> 5 With steadfast laws, wealth-giver, strong through Soma, he hath much fair and precious food to feed us.<br> In him unite all paths that lead to riches, like rivers that commingle with the ocean.<br> 6 Bring unto us the mightiest might, O Hero, strong and most potent force, thou great Subduer!<br> All splendid vigorous powers of men vouchsafe us, Lord of Bay Steeds, that they may make us joyful.<br> 7 Bring us, grown mighty in its strength, O Indra, thy friendly rapturous joy that wins the battle,<br> Wherewith by thee assisted and triumphant, we may laud thee in gaining seed and offspring.<br> 8 Indra, bestow on us the power heroic skilled and exceeding strong, that wins the booty,<br> Wherewith, by thine assistance, we may conquer our foes in battle, be they kin or stranger.<br> 9 Let thine heroic strength come from behind us, before us, from above us or below us.<br> From every side may it approach us, Indra. Give us the glory of the realm of splendour.<br> 10 With most heroic aid from thee, like heroes Indra, may we win wealth by deeds glory.<br> Thou, King, art Lord of earthly, heavenly treasure: vouchsafe us riches vast, sublime, and lasting.<br> 11 The Bull, whose strength hath waxed, whom Maruts follow, free-giving Indra, the Celestial Ruler,<br> Mighty, all-conquering, the victory-giver, him let us call to grant us new protection.<br> 12 Give up the people who are high and haughty to these men and to me, O Thunder-wielder!<br> Therefore upon the earth do we invoke thee, where heroes win, for sons and kine and waters.<br> 13 Through these thy friendships, God invoked of many! may we be victors over every foeman.<br> Slaying both kinds of foe, may we, O Hero, be happy, helped by thee, with ample riches.</p>
