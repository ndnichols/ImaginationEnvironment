<TD><P>These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>They shall put    
you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you     
will think that he doeth ELOHIYM service.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And these things will they do unto you, because   
they have not known the Father, nor me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>But these things have I told you, that when the   
time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I    
said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>But now I go my way to him that 
sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>But because I have said these       
things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is       
expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not  
come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he is come, he will        
reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Of sin, because they        
believe not on me;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Of judgment,    
because the prince of this world is judged.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye  
cannot bear them now.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you    
into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall      
hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>He shall glorify me: for  
he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>All things that the Father hath   
are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto  
you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>A       
little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall  
see me, because I go to the Father.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17>
<H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What   
is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and     
again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>They said       
therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he   
saith.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Now   
YAHSHUA knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye      
enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see   
me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Verily, verily, I say unto you,   
That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be     
sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>A woman when she is in travail    
hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the   
child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the 
world.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall    
rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And in that day ye shall ask me nothing.     
Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name,  
he will give it you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall        
receive, that your joy may be full.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25>
<H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the 
time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew  
you plainly of the Father.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>     
26</H4></TD><TD><P>At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, 
that I will pray the Father for you:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>For the Father himself loveth you, because ye   
have loved me, and have believed that I came out from ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>I came forth from the Father, 
and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>His disciples   
said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>Now are we sure that 
thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this  
we believe that thou camest forth from ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA answered them, Do ye now believe?</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>Behold, the     
hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his     
own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is    
with me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>    
These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the     
world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the      
world.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M.
