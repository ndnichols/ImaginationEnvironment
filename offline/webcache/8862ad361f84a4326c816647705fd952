<p>1. MOUNT the Bay Horses to thy chariot harnessed, and come to us like V&#257;yu with his coursers.<br> Thou, hastening to us, shalt drink the Soma. Hail, Indra. We have poured it for thy rapture.<br> 2 For him, the God who is invoked by many, the two swift Bay Steeds to the pole I harness,<br> That they in fleet course may bring Indra hither, e&#146;en to this sacrifice arranged completely.<br> 3 Bring the strong Steeds who drink the warm libation, and, Bull of Godlike nature, be thou gracious.<br> Let thy Steeds eat; set free thy Tawny Horses, and roasted grain like this consume thou daily.<br> 4 Those who are yoked by prayer I harness, fleet friendly Bays who take their joy together.<br> Mounting thy firm and easy car, O Indra, wise and all-knowing come thou to the Soma.<br> 5 No other worshippers must stay beside them thy Bays, thy vigorous and smooth-backed Coursers.<br> Pass by them all and hasten onward hither: with Soma pressed we will prepare to feast thee.<br> 6 Thine is this Soma: hasten to approach it. Drink thou thereof, benevolent, and cease not.<br> Sit on the sacred grass at this our worship, and take these drops into thy belly, Indra.<br> 7 The grass is strewn for thee, pressed is the Soma; the grain is ready for thy Bays to feed on.<br> To thee who lovest them, the very mighty, strong, girt by Maruts, are these gifts presented.<br> 8 This the sweet draught, with cows, the men, the mountains, the waters, Indra, have for thee made ready.<br> Come, drink thereof, Sublime One, friendly-minded, foreseeing, knowing well the ways thou goest.<br> 9 The Maruts, they with whom thou sharedst Soma, Indra, who made thee strong and were thine army,&#151;<br> With these accordant, eagerly desirous drink thou this Soma with the tongue of Agni.<br> 10 Drink, Indra, of the juice by thine own nature, or by the tongue of Agni, O thou Holy.<br> Accept the sacrificial gift, O &#346;akra, from the Adhvaryu's hand or from the Hotar's.<br> 11 Call we on Maghavan, auspicious Indra, best Hero in the fight where spoil is gathered,<br> The Strong, who listens, who.gives aid in battles, who slays the V&#7771;tras, wins and gathers riches.</p>
