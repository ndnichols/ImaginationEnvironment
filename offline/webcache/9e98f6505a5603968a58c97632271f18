<p>1. As for a chariot-race, the skilful Speaker, Chief, Sage, Inventor, hath, with song, been started.<br> The sisters ten upon the fleecy summit drive on the Car-horse to the resting places.<br> 2 The drop of Soma, pressed by wise Nahusyas, becomes the banquet of the Heavenly People-<br> Indu, by hands of mortal men made beauteous, immortal, with the sheep and cows and waters.<br> 3 Steer roaring unto Steer, this Pavamana, this juice runs to the white milk of the milch-cow.<br> Through thousand fine hairs goes the tuneful Singer, like S&#363;ra by his fair and open pathways.<br> 4 Break down the, strong seats even of the demons: cleansing thee, Indu, robd thyself in vigour.<br> Rend with thy swift bolt, coming from above them, those who are near and those who yet are distant.<br> 5 Prepare the forward paths in ancient manner for the new bymn, thou Giver of all bounties.<br> Those which are high and hard for foes to conquer may we gain from thee, Active! Food-bestower!<br> 6 So purifying thee vouchsafe us waters, heaven's light, and cows, offipring and many children.<br> Give us health, ample land, and lights, O Soma, and grant us long to look upon the sunshine.</p>
