<TD><P>And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal,        
proceeding out of the throne of ELOHIYM and of the Lamb.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>In the midst of the street of it,   
and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve  
manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree 
were for the healing of the nations.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3>
<H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of       
ELOHIYM and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And they shall    
see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And there shall be no night there;  
and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the ADONAY YHVH giveth   
them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto me, These sayings  
are faithful and true: and the ADONAY YHVH of the holy prophets sent his angel  
to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done.</P></TD></TR>

it not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of    
them which keep the sayings of this book: worship ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And he saith unto me, Seal not    
the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>He that is unjust, let

holy still.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>

him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life    
freely.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>For  
I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book,
