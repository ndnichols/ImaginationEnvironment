<p>1. BARDS of approaching Dawn who know the heavens are come with hymns to throw the mountain open.<br> The Sun hath risen and oped the stable portals: the doors of men, too, hath the God thrown open.<br> 2 S&#363;rya hath spread his light as splendour: hither came the Cows' Mother, conscious, from the stable,<br> To streams that flow with biting waves to deserts; and heaven is stablished like a firm-set pillar.<br> 3 This laud hath won the burden of the mountain. To aid the ancient birth of mighty waters<br> The mountain parted, Heaven performed his office. The worshippers were worn with constant serving.<br> 4 With hymns and God-loved words will I invoke you, Indra and Agni, to obtain your favour,<br> For verily sages, skilled in sacrificing, worship the Maruts and with lauds invite them.<br> 5 This day approach us: may our thoughts be holy, far from us let us cast away misfortune.<br> Let us keep those who hate us at a distance, and haste to meet the man who sacrifices.<br> 6 Come, let us carry out, O friends, the purpose wherewith the Mother threw the Cow's stall open,<br> That wherewith Manu conquered Visisipra, wherewith the wandering merchant gained heaven's water.<br> 7 Here, urged by hands, loudly hath rung the press-stone wherewith Navagvas through ten months sang praises.<br> Saram&#257; went aright and found the cattle. A&#7749;giras gave effect to all their labours.<br> 8 When at the dawning of this mighty Goddess, A&#7749;girases all sang forth with the cattle,&#151;<br> Their spring is in the loftiest place of meeting,&#151;Saram&#257; found the kine by Order's pathway.<br> 9 Borne by his Coursers Seven may S&#363;rya visit the field that spreadeth wide for his long journey.<br> Down on the Soma swooped the rapid Falcon. Bright was the young Sage moving mid his cattle.<br> 10 S&#363;rya hath mounted to the shining ocean when he hath yoked his fair-backed Tawny Horses.<br> The wise have drawn him like a ship through water: the floods obedient have descended hither.<br> 11 I lay upon the Floods your hymn, lightwinning, wherewith Navagvas their ten months completed.<br> Through this our hymn may we have Gods to guard us: through this our hymn pass safe beyond affliction.</p>
