<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus saith YHVH unto me, Go and 
get thee a linen girdle, and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>So I got a girdle 
according to the word of YHVH, and put it on my loins.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And the word of YHVH came unto me   
the second time, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>Take the girdle that thou hast got, which is upon thy loins, and    
arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>So I went, and hid it by    
Euphrates, as YHVH commanded me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>
6</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass after many days, that YHVH said unto me,  
Arise, go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded thee 
to hide there.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>
Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where  
I had hid it: and, behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable for         
nothing.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Then  
the word of YHVH came unto me, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus saith YHVH, After this manner will I mar the 
pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>This evil people, which refuse to 
hear my words, which walk in the imagination of their heart, and walk after     
other gods, to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle,   
which is good for nothing.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>     
11</H4></TD><TD><P>For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I  
caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of       
Judah, saith YHVH; that they might be unto me for a people, and for a name, and 
for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore thou shalt speak unto   
them this word; Thus saith YHVH ELOHIYM of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled 
with wine: and they shall say unto thee, Do we not certainly know that every    
bottle shall be filled with wine?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13>  
<H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith YHVH, Behold,  
I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon      
David's throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of   
Jerusalem, with drunkenness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>   
14</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers   
and the sons together, saith YHVH: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy,  
but destroy them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for YHVH hath spoken.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Give glory to YHVH your   
ELOHIYM, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark   
mountains, and, while ye look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death,   
and make it gross darkness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>    
17</H4></TD><TD><P>But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret     
places for your pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears,   
because YHVH's flock is carried away captive.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble   
yourselves, sit down: for your principalities shall come down, even the crown   
of your glory.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open them: Judah    
shall be carried away captive all of it, it shall be wholly carried away        
captive.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where is the flock 
that was given thee, thy beautiful flock?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee?   
for thou hast taught them to be captains, and as chief over thee: shall not     
sorrows take thee, as a woman in travail?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore come  
these things upon me? For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts        
discovered, and thy heels made bare.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore will  
I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the              
wilderness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P> 
This is thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith YHVH; because thou  
hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy   
face, that thy shame may appear.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27>   
<H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the     
lewdness of thy whoredom, and thine abominations on the hills in the fields.    
Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! wilt thou not be made clean? when shall it once     
be?</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M. Hurt,
