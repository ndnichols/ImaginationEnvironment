were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the       
wilderness of Sinai.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of     
Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the    
mount.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And     
Moses went up unto ELOHIYM, and YHVH called unto him out of the mountain,       
saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of     
Israel;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye     
have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings,   
and brought you unto myself.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>

covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for    
all the earth is mine:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.   
These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses came and     
called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these      
words which YHVH commanded him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>

YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH 
said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may     
hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the      
words of the people unto YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>

<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And be ready against the

<TD><P>And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed 
to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it:     
whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>There shall not an hand touch it, 
but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it  
shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the       
mount.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and  
they washed their clothes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>     
15</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: 
come not at your wives.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there     
were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice   
of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp      
trembled.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with ELOHIYM; and    
they stood at the nether part of the mount.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke,      
because YHVH descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the   
smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the voice of the trumpet 
sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and ELOHIYM answered    
him by a voice.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And YHVH came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and YHVH       
called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH said unto Moses, Go  
down, charge the people, lest they break through unto YHVH to gaze, and many of 
them perish.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>
And let the priests also, which come near to YHVH, sanctify themselves, lest    
YHVH break forth upon them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>    
23</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses said unto YHVH, The people cannot come up to mount 
Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify  
it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH

with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto 
YHVH, lest he break forth upon them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A
