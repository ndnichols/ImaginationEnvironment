<p>1. I CALL your chariot to receive united praise mid princely men,<br> Strong Gods who pour down wealth, of never vanquished might!<br> 2 Ye to Varosusaman come, N&#257;satyas, for this glorious rite.<br> With your protecting aid. Strong Gods, who pour down wealth.<br> 3 So with oblations we invoke you, rich in ample wealth, to-day,<br> When night hath passed, O ye who send us plenteous food.<br> O A&#347;vins, Heroes, let your car, famed, best to travel, come to us,<br> And, for his glory, mark your zealous servant's lauds.<br> 5 A&#347;vins, who send us precious gifts, even when offended, think of him:<br> For ye, O Rudras, lead us safe beyond our foes.<br> 6 For, Wonder-Workers, with fleet steeds ye fly completely round this All,<br> Stirring our thoughts, ye Lords of splendour, honey-hued.<br> 7 With all-sustaining opulence, A&#347;vins, come hitherward to us,<br> Ye rich and noble Heroes, ne&#146;er to be o&#146;erthrown.<br> 8 To welcome this mine offering, O ye Indra-like N&#257;satyas, come<br> As Gods of best accord this day with other Gods.<br> 9 For we, like Vya&#347;va, lifting up our voice like oxen, call on you:<br> With all your loving kindness, Sages, come to us.<br> 10 O &#7770;&#7779;i, laud the A&#347;vins well. Will they not listen to thy call?<br> Will they not burn the Pa&#7751;is who are nearer them?<br> 11 O Heroes, listen to the son of Vya&#347;va, and regard me here,<br> Varu&#7751;a, Mitra, Aryaman, of one accord.<br> 12 Gods whom we yearn for, of your gifts, of what ye bring to us, bestow<br> By princes' hands on me, ye Mighty, day by day.<br> 13 Him whom your sacrifices clothe, even as a woman with her robe,<br> The A&#347;vins help to glory honouring him well.<br> 14 Whoso regards your care of men as succour widest in its reach,<br> About his dwelling go, ye A&#347;vins, loving us.<br> 15 Come to us ye who pour down wealth, come to the home which men must guard:<br> Like shafts, ye are made meet for sacrifice by song.<br> 16 Most fetching of all calls, the laud, as envoy, Heroes, called to you<br> Be it your own, O A&#347;vin Pair.<br> 17 Be ye in yonder sea of heaven, or joying in the home of food,<br> Listen to me, Immortal Ones.<br> 18 This river with his lucid flow attracts you, more than all the streams,&#151;<br> Even Sindhu with his path of gold.<br> 19 O A&#347;vins, with that glorious fame come hither, through our brilliant song,<br> Come ye whose ways are marked with light.<br> 20 Harness the steeds who draw the car, O Vasu, bring the well-fed pair.<br> O V&#257;yu, drink thou of our meath: come unto our drink-offerings.<br> 21 Wonderful V&#257;yu, Lord of Right, thou who art Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar's son-in-law,<br> Thy saving succour we elect.<br> 22 To Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar's son-in-law we pray for wealth whereof he hath control:<br> For glory we seek vayu, men with juice effused.<br> 23 From heaven, auspicious V&#257;yu, come drive hither with thy noble steeds:<br> Come on thy mighty car with wide-extending seat.<br> 24 We call thee to the homes of men, thee wealthiest in noble food,<br> And liberal as a press-stone with a horse's back.<br> 25 So, glad and joyful in thine heart, do thou, God, V&#257;yu, first of all<br> Vouchsafe us water, strength, and thought.</p>
