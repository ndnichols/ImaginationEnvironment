<p>1. A THOUSAND heads hath Puru&#7779;a, a thousand eyes, a thousand feet.<br> On every side pervading earth he fills a space ten fingers wide.<br> 2 This Puru&#7779;a is all that yet hath been and all that is to be;<br> The Lord of Immortality which waxes greater still by food.<br> 3 So mighty is his greatness; yea, greater than this is Puru&#7779;a.<br> All creatures are one-fourth of him, three-fourths eternal life in heaven.<br> 4 With three-fourths Puru&#7779;a went up: one-fourth of him again was here.<br> Thence he strode out to every side over what cats not and what cats.<br> 5 From him Vir&#257;j was born; again Puru&#7779;a from Vir&#257;j was born.<br> As soon as he was born he spread eastward and westward o&#146;er the earth.<br> 6 When Gods prepared the sacrifice with Puru&#7779;a as their offering,<br> Its oil was spring, the holy gift was autumn; summer was the wood.<br> 7 They balmed as victim on the grass Puru&#7779;a born in earliest time.<br> With him the Deities and all S&#257;dhyas and &#7770;&#7779;is sacrificed.<br> 8 From that great general sacrifice the dripping fat was gathered up.<br> He formed the creatures of-the air, and animals both wild and tame.<br> 9 From that great general sacrifice &#7770;cas and S&#257;ma-hymns were born:<br> Therefrom were spells and charms produced; the Yajus had its birth from it.<br> 10 From it were horses born, from it all cattle with two rows of teeth:<br> From it were generated kine, from it the goats and sheep were born.<br> 11 When they divided Puru&#7779;a how many portions did they make?<br> What do they call his mouth, his arms? What do they call his thighs and feet?<br> 12 The Brahman was his mouth, of both his arms was the R&#257;janya made.<br> His thighs became the Vai&#347;ya, from his feet the &#346;&#363;dra was produced.<br> 13 The Moon was gendered from his mind, and from his eye the Sun had birth;<br> Indra and Agni from his mouth were born, and V&#257;yu from his breath.<br> 14 Forth from his navel came mid-air the sky was fashioned from his head<br> Earth from his feet, and from his car the regions. Thus they formed the worlds.<br> 15 Seven fencing-sticks had he, thrice seven layers of fuel were prepared,<br> When the Gods, offering sacrifice, bound, as their victim, Puru&#7779;a.<br> 16 Gods, sacrificing, sacrificed the victim these were the earliest holy ordinances.<br> The Mighty Ones attained the height of heaven, there where the S&#257;dhyas, Gods of old, are dwelling.</p>
