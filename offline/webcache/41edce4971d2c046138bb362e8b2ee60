1</H4></TD><TD><P>And the word of YHVH came unto me, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Son of man, set thy face        
against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and      
prophesy against him,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And say, Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog,   
the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will turn thee back, and put hooks into thy 
jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all 
of them clothed with all sorts of armour, even a great company with bucklers    
and shields, all of them handling swords:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them; all of     
them with shield and helmet:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>    
6</H4></TD><TD><P>Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah of the north  
quarters, and all his bands: and many people with thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Be thou prepared, and prepare for   
thyself, thou, and all thy company that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a  
guard unto them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou shalt come   
into the land that is brought back from the sword, and is gathered out of many  
people, against the mountains of Israel, which have been always waste: but it   
is brought forth out of the nations, and they shall dwell safely all of         
them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou     
shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the     
land, thou, and all thy bands, and many people with thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH; It    
shall also come to pass, that at the same time shall things come into thy mind, 
and thou shalt think an evil thought:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of 
unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all   
of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates,</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>To take a spoil, and to   
take a prey; to turn thine hand upon the desolate places that are now           
inhabited, and upon the people that are gathered out of the nations, which have 
gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the midst of the land.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Sheba, and Dedan, and the     
merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee,   
Art thou come to take a spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey?   
to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great   
spoil?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>      
Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH;   
In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth safely, shalt thou not know       
it?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And thou 
shalt come from thy place out of the north parts, thou, and many people with    
thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company, and a mighty army:</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And thou shalt  
come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be  
in the latter days, and I will bring thee against my land, that the heathen may 
know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus saith the       
ADONAY YHVH; Art thou he of whom I have spoken in old time by my servants the   
prophets of Israel, which prophesied in those days many years that I would      
bring thee against them?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come      
against the land of Israel, saith the ADONAY YHVH, that my fury shall come up   
in my face.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P> 
For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that    
day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>So that the fishes of the sea,    
and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping      
things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the face of the 
earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and  
the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will call for  
a sword against him throughout all my mountains, saith the ADONAY YHVH: every   
man's sword shall be against his brother.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will plead against him with pestilence    
and with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many 
people that are with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and  
brimstone.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known in the     
eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I am YHVH.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
