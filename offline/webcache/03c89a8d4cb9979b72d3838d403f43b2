</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>Now concerning    
spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye know that ye were Gentiles,      
carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore I give you to understand, 
that no man speaking by the Spirit of ELOHIYM calleth YAHSHUA accursed: and     
that no man can say that YAHSHUA is the ADONAY, but by the Holy Ghost.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Now there are          
diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And there are differences of administrations, but 
the same ADONAY.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same ELOHIYM which    
worketh all in all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit      
withal.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>For to 
one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge 
by the same Spirit;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by  
the same Spirit;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another      
discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the       
interpretation of tongues:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>     
11</H4></TD><TD><P>But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit,      
dividing to every man severally as he will.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>For as the body is one, and hath many members,  
and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is      
MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>  
For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or      
Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one  
Spirit.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>For  
the body is not one member, but many.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>If the foot shall say, Because I am not the     
hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And if the ear shall say,     
Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the      
body?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>If the 
whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing,      
where were the smelling?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4>
</TD><TD><P>But now hath ELOHIYM set the members every one of them in the body, 
as it hath pleased him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And if they were all one member, where were the body?</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>But now are they many     
members, yet but one body.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>     
21</H4></TD><TD><P>And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of      
thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Nay, much more those members  
of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And those members of the body,    
which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant        
honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>For our comely parts have no  
need: but ELOHIYM hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant   
honour to that part which lacked.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25>  
<H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>That there should be no schism in the body; but that the 
members should have the same care one for another.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And whether one member suffer,    
all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members      
rejoice with it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Now ye are the body of MASHIYACH, and members in particular.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And ELOHIYM hath set 
some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers,     
after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of 
tongues.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Are 
all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of            
miracles?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>But covet       
earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.</P></TD>
