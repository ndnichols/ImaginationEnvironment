1</H4></TD><TD><P>At the same time came the disciples unto YAHSHUA, saying, Who 
is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA called a little child unto him, and   
set him in the midst of them,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>   
3</H4></TD><TD><P>And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and  
become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Whosoever         
therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in    
the kingdom of heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth  
me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>But whoso  
shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for   
him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in    
the depth of the sea.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that        
offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore if thy hand or thy    
foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee  
to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to  
be cast into everlasting fire.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>  
9</H4></TD><TD><P>And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from  
thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having 
two eyes to be cast into hell fire.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10>
<H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones;  
for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my 
Father which is in heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>     
11</H4></TD><TD><P>For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>How think ye?   
if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not     
leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which 
is gone astray?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of    
that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Even so it is not the will of 
your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover if thy 
brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and 
him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>But if he will not hear   
thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three    
witnesses every word may be established.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it   
unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as  
an heathen man and a publican.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4> 
18</H4></TD><TD><P>Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth     
shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be       
loosed in heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as         
touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father  
which is in heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD>
<TD><P>For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in   
the midst of them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Then came Peter to him, and said, ADONAY, how oft shall my brother sin   
against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA saith unto him, I say not 
unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore is the kingdom of   
heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his             
servants.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten   
thousand talents.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold,   
and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>The servant     
therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me,   
and I will pay thee all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed 
him, and forgave him the debt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4> 
28</H4></TD><TD><P>But the same servant went out, and found one of his          
fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and  
took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And his fellowservant fell down   
at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay    
thee all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the     
debt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>So     
when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and   
told unto their lord all that was done.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>Then his lord, after that he had called him,    
said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because     
thou desiredst me:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even   
as I had pity on thee?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till   
he should pay all that was due unto him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also    
unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their        
trespasses.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M.
