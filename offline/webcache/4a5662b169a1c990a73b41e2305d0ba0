<p>1. This light is come, amid all lights the fairest; born is the brilliant, far-extending brightness.<br> Night, sent away for Savitar's uprising, hath yielded up a birth-place for the Morning.<br> 2 The Fair, the Bright is come with her white offspring; to her the Dark One hath resigned her dwelling.<br> Akin, immortal, following each other, changing their colours both the heavens move onward.<br> 3 Common, unending is the Sisters' pathway; taught by the Gods, alternately they travel.<br> Fair-formed, of different hues and yet one-minded, Night and Dawn clash not, neither do they travel.<br> 4 Bright leader of glad sounds, our eyes behold her; splendid in hue she hath unclosed the portals.<br> She, stirring up the world, hath shown us riches: Dawn hath awakened every living creature.<br> 5 Rich Dawn, she sets afoot the coiled-up sleeper, one for enjoyment, one for wealth or worship,<br> Those who saw little for extended vision. All living creatures hath the Dawn awakened.<br> 6 One to high sway, one to exalted glory, one to pursue his gain, and one his labour:<br> All to regard their different vocations, all moving creatures hath the Dawn awakened.<br> 7 We see her there, the Child of Heaven apparent, the young Maid, flushing in her shining raiment.<br> Thou sovran Lady of all earthly treasure, flush on us here, auspicious Dawn, this morning.<br> 8 She first of endless morns to come hereafter, follows the path of morns that have departed.<br> Dawn, at her rising, urges forth the living him who is dead she wakes not from his slumber.<br> 9 As thou, Dawn, hast caused Agni to be kindled, and with the Sun's eye hast revealed creation.<br> And hast awakened men to offer worship, thou hast performed, for Gods, a noble service.<br> 10 How long a time, and they shall be together,&#151;Dawns that have shone and Dawns to shine hereafter?<br> She yearns for former Dawns with eager longing, and goes forth gladly shining with the others.<br> 11 Gone are the men who in the days before us looked on the rising of the earlier Morning.<br> We, we the living, now behold her brightness and they come nigh who shall hereafter see her.<br> 12 Foe-chaser, born of Law, the Law's protectress, joy-giver, waker of all pleasant voices,<br> Auspicious, bringing food for Gods&#146; enjoyment, shine on us here, most bright, O Dawn, this morning.<br> 13 From days eternal hath Dawn shone, the Goddess, and shows this light to-day, endowed with riches.<br> So will she shine on days to come immortal she moves on in her own strength, undecaying.<br> 14 In the sky's borders hath she shone in splendour: the Goddess hath thrown off the veil of darkness.<br> Awakening the world with purple horses, on her well-harnessed chariot Dawn approaches.<br> 15 Bringing all life-sustaining blessings with her, showing herself she sends forth brilliant lustre.<br> Last of the countless mornings that have vanished, first of bright morns to come hath Dawn arisen.<br> 16 Arise! the breath, the life, again hath reached us: darkness hath passed away and light approacheth.<br> She for the Sun hath left a path to travel we have arrived where men prolong existence.<br> 17 Singing the praises of refulgent Mornings with his hymn's web the priest, the poet rises.<br> Shine then to-day, rich Maid, on him who lauds thee, shine down on us the gift of life and offspring.<br> 18 Dawns giving sons all heroes, kine and horses, shining upon the man who brings oblations,&#151;<br> These let the Soma-presser gain when ending his glad songs louder than the voice of V&#257;yu.<br> 19 Mother of Gods, Aditi's form of glory, ensign of sacrifice, shine forth exalted.<br> Rise up, bestowing praise on our devotion all-bounteous, make us chief among the people.<br> 20 Whatever splendid wealth the Dawns bring with them to bless the man who offers praise and worship,<br> Even that may Mitra, Varu&#7751;a vouchsafe us, and Aditi and Sindhu, Earth and Heaven.</p>
