<p>1. Now let us publish, for the vigorous company the herald of the Strong One, their primeval might.<br> With fire upon your way, O Maruts loud of voice, with battle, Mighty Ones, achieve your deeds of strength.<br> 2 Bringing the pleasant meath as &#146;twere their own dear son, they sport in sportive wise gay at their gatherings.<br> The Rudras come with succour to the worshipper; self-strong they fail not him who offers sacrifice.<br> 3 To whomsoever, bringer of oblations, they immortal guardians, have given plenteous wealth,<br> For him, like loving friends, the Maruts bringing bliss bedew the regions round with milk abundantly.<br> 4 Ye who with mighty powers have stirred the regions up, your coursers have sped forth directed by themselves.<br> All creatures of the earth, all dwellings are afraid, for brilliant is your coming with your spears advanced.<br> 5 When they in dazzling rush have made the mountains roar, and shaken heaven's high back in their heroic strength,<br> Each sovran of the forest fears as ye drive near, aid the shrubs fly before you swift as whirling wheels.<br> 6 Terrible Maruts, ye with ne&#146;er-diminished host, with great benevolence fulfil our heart's desire.<br> Where&#146;er your lightning bites armed with its gory teeth it crunches up the cattle like a well-aimed dart.<br> 7 Givers of during gifts whose bounties never fail, free from ill-will, at sacrifices glorified,<br> They sing their song aloud that they may drink sweet juice: well do they know the Hero's first heroic deeds.<br> 8 With castles hundredfold, O Maruts, guard ye well the man whom ye have loved from ruin and from sin,&#151;<br> The man whom ye the fierce, the Mighty ones who roar, preserve from calumny by cherishing his seed.<br> 9 O Maruts, in your cars are all things that are good: great powers are set as &#146;twere in rivalry therein.<br> Rings are upon your shoulders when ye journey forth: your axle turns together both the chariot wheels.<br> 10 Held in your manly arms are many goodly things, gold chains are on your chests, and glistering ornaments,<br> Deer-skins are on their shoulders, on their fellies knives: they spread their glory out as birds spread out their wings.<br> 11 Mighty in mightiness, pervading, passing strong, visible from afar as &#146;twere with stars of heaven,<br> Lovely with pleasant tongues, sweet singers with their mouths, the Maruts, joined with Indra, shout forth all around.<br> 12 This is your majesty, ye Maruts nobly born, far as the sway of Aditi your bounty spreads.<br> Even Indra by desertion never disannuls the boon bestowed by you upon the pious man.<br> 13 This is your kinship, Maruts, that, Immortals, ye were oft in olden time regardful of our call,<br> Having vouchsafed to man a hearing through this prayer, by wondrous deeds the Heroes have displayed their might.<br> 14 That, O ye Maruts, we may long time flourish through your abundant riches, O swift movers,<br> And that our men may spread in the encampment, let me complete the rite with these oblations.<br> 15 May this your laud, may this your song, O Maruts, sung by the poet, M&#257;na's son, M&#257;nd&#257;rya,<br> Bring offspring for ourselves with food to feed us. May we find strengthening food in full abundance.</p>
