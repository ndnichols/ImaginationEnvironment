<p>1. VASTOSPATI, who killest all disease and wearest every form,<br> Be an auspicious Friend to us.<br> 2 When, O bright Son of Saram&#257;, thou showest, tawny-hued! thy teeth,<br> They gleam like lances' points within thy mouth when thou wouldst bite; go thou to steep.<br> 3 Saram&#257;'s Son, retrace thy way: bark at the robber and the thief.<br> At Indra's singers barkest thou? Why dust thou seek to terrify us? Go to sleep.<br> 4 Be on thy guard against the boar, and let the boar beware of thee.<br> At Indra's singers barkest thou? Why dost thou seek to terrify us? Go to sleep.<br> 5 Sleep mother, let the father sleep, sleep dog and master of the house.<br> Let all the kinsmen sleep, sleep all the people who are round about.<br> 6 The man who sits, the man who walks, and whosoever looks on us,<br> Of these we closely shut the eyes, even as we closely shut this house.<br> 7 The Bull who hath a thousand horns, who rises up from out the sea,&#151;<br> By him the Strong and Mighty One we lull and make the people sleep.<br> 8 The women sleeping in the court, lying without, or stretched on beds,<br> The matrons with their odorous sweetsthese, one and all, we lull to sleep.</p>
