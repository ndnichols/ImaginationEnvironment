<p>1. COME to this sacrifice of ours, O Agni, threefold, with seven threads and five divisions.<br> Be our oblation-bearer and preceder: thou hast lain long enough in during darkness.<br> 2 I come a God foreseeing from the godless to immortality by secret pathways,<br> While I, ungracious one, desert the gracious, leave mine own friends and seek the kin of strangers.<br> 3 1, looking to the guest of other lineage, have founded many a rule of Law and Order.<br> I bid farewell to the Great God, the Father, and, for neglect, obtain my share of worship.<br> 4 I tarried many a year within this altar: I leave the Father, for my choice is Indra.<br> Away pass Agni, Varu&#7751;a and Soma. Rule ever changes: this I come to favour.<br> 5 These Asuras have lost their powers of magic. But thou, O Varu&#7751;a, if thou dost love me,<br> O King, discerning truth and right from falsehood, come and be Lord and Ruler of my kingdom.<br> 6 Here is the light of heaven, here allis lovely; here there is radiance, here is air's wide region.<br> Let us two slaughter V&#7771;tra. Forth, O Soma! Thou art oblation: we therewith will serve thee.<br> 7 The Sage hath fixed his form by wisdom in the heavens: Varu&#7751;a with no violence let the waters flow.<br> Like women-folk, the floods that bring prosperity have eau lit his hue and colour as they gleamed and shone.<br> 8 These wait upon his loftiest power and vigour: he dwells in these who triumph in their Godhead;<br> And they, like people who elect their ruler, have in abhorrence turned away from V&#7771;tra.<br> 9 They call him Swan, the abhorrent floods' Companion, moving in friendship with celestial Waters.<br> The poets in their thought have looked on Indra swiftly approaching when Anustup calls him.</p>
