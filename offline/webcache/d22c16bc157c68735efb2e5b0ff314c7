<TD><P>Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are  
of ELOHIYM: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Hereby know ye the     
Spirit of EL: Every spirit that confesseth that YAHSHUA MASHIYACH is come in    
the flesh is of ELOHIYM:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And every spirit that confesseth not that YAHSHUA MASHIYACH is come 
in the flesh is not of ELOHIYM: and this is that spirit of antiMASHIYACH,       
whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the    
world.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye are  
of ELOHIYM, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that 
is in you, than he that is in the world.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

the world, and the world heareth them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

he that is not of EL heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and    
the spirit of error.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of ELOHIYM; and every one  
that loveth is born of EL, and knoweth EL.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

love.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>In this  
was manifested the love of ELOHIYM toward us, because that EL sent his only     
begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Herein is love, not that we   
loved ELOHIYM, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation    
for our sins.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Beloved, if ELOHIYM so loved us, we ought also to love one another.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>No man hath seen     
ELOHIYM at any time. If we love one another, EL dwelleth in us, and his love is 
perfected in us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given 
us of his Spirit.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the   
Saviour of the world.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>Whosoever shall confess that YAHSHUA is the Son of ELOHIYM, EL      
dwelleth in him, and he in EL.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4> 
16</H4></TD><TD><P>And we have known and believed the love that ELOHIYM hath to 
us. EL is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in EL, and EL in him.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Herein is our   
love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as 
he is, so are we in this world.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>
18</H4></TD><TD><P>There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: 
because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>We love him, because

he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love EL whom he    
hath not seen?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth ELOHIYM love his   
brother also.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John
