<p>1. MINISTERS, bring the Soma juice for Indra, pour forth the gladdening liquor with the beakers.<br> To drink of this the Hero longeth ever; offer it to the Bull, for this he willeth.<br> 2 Ye ministers, to him who with the lightning smote, like a tree, the rain-withholding V&#7771;tra&#151;<br> Bring it to him, him who is fain to taste it, a draught of this which Indra here deserveth.<br> 3 Ye ministers, to him who smote D&#7771;bh&#299;ka, who drove the kine forth, and discovered Vala,<br> Offer this draught, like Vita in the region: clothe him with Soma even as steeds with trappings.<br> 4 Him who did Ura&#7751;a to death, Adhvaryus! though showing arms ninety-and-nine in number;<br> Who cast down headlong Arbuda and slew him,&#151;speed ye that Indra to our offered Soma.<br> 5 Ye ministers, to him who struck down Sva&#347;na, and did to death Vya&#7745;sa and greedy &#346;u&#7779;&#7751;a,<br> And Rudhikr&#257;s and Namuci and Pipru,&#151;to him, to Indra, pour ye forth libation.<br> 6 Ye ministers, to him who as with thunder demolished &#346;ambara's hundred ancient castles;<br> Who cast down Varcin's sons, a hundred thousand,&#151;to him, to Indra, offer ye the Soma.<br> 7 Ye ministers, to him who slew a hundred thousand, and cast them down upon earth's bosom;<br> Who quelled the valiant men of Atithigva, Kutsa, and &#256;yu,&#151;bring to him the Soma.<br> 8 Ministers, men, whatever thing ye long for obtain ye quickly bringing gifts to Indra.<br> Bring to the Glorious One what bands have cleansed; to Indra bring, ye pious ones, the Soma.<br> 9 Do ye, O ministers, obey his order: that purified in wood, in wood uplift ye.<br> Well pleased he longs for what your hands have tended: offer the gladdening Soma juice to Indra.<br> 10 As the cow's udder teems with milk, Adhvaryus, so fill with Soma Indra, liberal giver.<br> I know him: I am sure of this, the Holy knows that I fain would give to him more largely.<br> 11 Him, ministers, the Lord of heavenly treasure and all terrestrial wealth that earth possesses,<br> Him, Indra, fill with Soma as a garner is filled with barley full: be this your labour.<br> 12 Prepare thyself to grant us that great booty, O Vasu, for abundant is thy treasure.<br> Gather up wondrous wealth, O Indra, daily. Loud may we speak, with heroes, in assembly.</p>
