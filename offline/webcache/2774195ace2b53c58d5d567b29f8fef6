<p>1. SAVITAR fixed the earth with bands to bind it, and made heaven stedfast where no prop supported.<br> Savitar milked, as &#146;twere a restless courser, air, sea bound fast to what no foot had trodden.<br> 2 Well knoweth Savitar, O Child of Waters, where ocean, firmly fixt, o&#146;erflowed its limit.<br> Thence sprang the world, from that uprose the region: thence heaven spread out and the wide earth expanded.<br> 3 Then, with a full crowd of Immortal Beings, this other realm came later, high and holy.<br> First, verily, Savitar's strong-pinioned Eagle was born: and he obeys his law for ever.<br> 4 As warriors to their steeds, kine to their village, as fond milk giving cows approach their youngling,<br> As man to wife, let Savitar come downward to us, heaven's bearer, Lord of every blessing.<br> 5 Like the A&#7749;girasa Hiranvastupa, I call thee, Savitar, to this achievement:<br> So worshipping and lauding thee for favour I watch for thee as for the stalk of Soma.</p>
