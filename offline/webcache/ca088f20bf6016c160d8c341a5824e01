when I plead with thee: yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments: Wherefore   
doth the way of the wicked prosper? wherefore are all they happy that deal very 
treacherously?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>
Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow, yea, they bring   
forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>But thou, O YHVH,      
knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine heart toward thee: pull them out  
like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.</P>

the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them 
that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said,  
He shall not see our last end.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>

thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and if in the land of peace,     
wherein thou trustedst, they wearied thee, then how wilt thou do in the         
swelling of Jordan?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt

them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

devour.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Many
