1</H4></TD><TD><P>And the word of YHVH came unto me, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Son of man, put forth a riddle, 
and speak a parable unto the house of Israel;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And say, Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH; A great   
eagle with great wings, longwinged, full of feathers, which had divers colours, 
came unto Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar:</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>He cropped off the top of his   
young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffick; he set it in a city of     
merchants.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>He  
took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; he       
placed it by great waters, and set it as a willow tree.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And it grew, and became a spreading 
vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof    
were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth 
sprigs.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>There  
was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold,   
this vine did bend her roots toward him, and shot forth her branches toward     
him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>It was planted in a good soil   
by great waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear     
fruit, that it might be a goodly vine.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Say thou, Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH; Shall it    
prosper? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, 
that it wither? it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring, even without   
great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Yea, behold, being        
planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind      
toucheth it? it shall wither in the furrows where it grew.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover the word of YHVH came    
unto me, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things mean?     
tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem, and hath taken the 
king thereof, and the princes thereof, and led them with him to Babylon;</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And hath taken  
of the king's seed, and made a covenant with him, and hath taken an oath of     
him: he hath also taken the mighty of the land:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>That the kingdom might be base, that it      
might not lift itself up, but that by keeping of his covenant it might          
stand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>But   
he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might  
give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth   
such things? or shall he break the covenant, and be delivered?</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>As I live, saith the ADONAY   
YHVH, surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose     
oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, even with him in the midst of    
Babylon he shall die.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make   
for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut off many   
persons:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given    
his hand, and hath done all these things, he shall not escape.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore thus saith the      
ADONAY YHVH; As I live, surely mine oath that he hath despised, and my covenant 
that he hath broken, even it will I recompense upon his own head.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will spread my net  
upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon,   
and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against  
me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And all  
his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain  
shall be scattered toward all winds: and ye shall know that I YHVH have spoken  
it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus     
saith the ADONAY YHVH; I will also take of the highest branch of the high       
cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a       
tender one, and will plant it upon an high mountain and eminent:</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>In the mountain of the    
height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear     
fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing;  
in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And all the trees of the field    
shall know that I YHVH have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low    
tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I   
YHVH have spoken and have done it.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
