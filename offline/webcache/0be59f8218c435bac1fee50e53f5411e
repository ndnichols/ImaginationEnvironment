<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And I sent them with

ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
by the good hand of our ELOHIYM upon us they brought us a man of understanding,

VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Then I proclaimed a fast there,   
at the river of Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our ELOHIYM, to   
seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our        
substance.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>  
For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to     
help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king,      
saying, The hand of our ELOHIYM is upon all them for good that seek him; but    
his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>So we fasted and besought our 
ELOHIYM for this: and he was intreated of us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Then I separated twelve of the chief of the  
priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And weighed unto     
them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering of the house  
of our ELOHIYM, which the king, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all     
Israel there present, had offered:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26> 
<H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty     
talents of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, and of gold an        
hundred talents;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine 
copper, precious as gold.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>      
28</H4></TD><TD><P>And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto YHVH; the vessels are 
holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto YHVH        
ELOHIYM of your fathers.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chief of    
the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem,  
in the chambers of the house of YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto   
the house of our ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>      
31</H4></TD><TD><P>Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day  
of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our ELOHIYM was upon  
us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait  
by the way.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>Now on the fourth day was the     
silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our ELOHIYM by the  
hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son  
of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son   
of Binnui, Levites;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD>
<TD><P>By number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was written at  
that time.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Also the children of those that had been carried away, which were come out of   
the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the ELOHIYM of Israel, twelve       
bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve   
he goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering unto YHVH.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>And they delivered   
the king's commissions unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on     
this side the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of            
ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M.
