<p>1. SAY, bringing sacrifice to bounteous Rudra, This juice for drink to you whose wrath is fleeting!<br> With Dyaus the Asura's Heroes I have lauded the Maruts as with prayer to Earth and Heaven.<br> 2 Strong to exalt the early invocation are Night and Dawn who show with varied aspect.<br> The Barren clothes her in wide-woven raiment, and fair Morn shines with S&#363;rya's golden splendour.<br> 3 Cheer us the Roamer round, who strikes at morning, the Wind delight us, pourer forth of waters!<br> Sharpen our wits, O Parvata and Indra. May all the Gods vouchsafe to us this favour.<br> 4 And Au&#347;ija shall call for me that famous Pair who enjoy and drink, who come to brighten.<br> Set ye the Offspring of the Floods before you; both Mothers of the Living One who beameth.<br> 5 For you shall Au&#347;ija call him who thunders, as, to win Arjuna's assent, cried Gho&#7779;&#257;.<br> I will invoke, that P&#363;&#7779;an may be bounteous to you, the rich munificence of Agni.<br> 6 Hear, Mitra-Varu&#7751;a, these mine invocations, hear them from all men in the hall of worship.<br> Giver of famous gifts, kind hearer, Sindhu who gives fair fields, listen with all his waters!<br> 7 Praised, Mitra, Varu&#7751;a! is your gift, a hundred cows to the P&#7771;k&#7779;ay&#257;mas and the Pajra.<br> Presented by car-famous Priyaratha, supplying nourishment, they came directly.<br> 8 Praised is the gift of him the very wealthy: may we enjoy it, men with hero children:<br> His who hath many gifts to give the Pajras, a chief who makes me rich in cars and horses.<br> 9 The folk, O Mitra-Varu&#7751;a, who hate you, who sinfully hating pour you no libations,<br> Lay in their hearts, themselves, a wasting sickness, whereas the righteous gaineth all by worship.<br> 10 That man, most puissant, wondrously urged onward, famed among heroes, liberal in giving,<br> Moveth a warrior, evermore undaunted in all encounters even with the mighty.<br> 11 Come to the man's, the sacrificer's calling: hear, Kings of Immortality, joy-givers!<br> While ye who speed through clouds decree your bounty largely, for fame, to him the chariot rider.<br> 12 Vigour will we bestow on that adorer whose tenfold draught we come to taste, so spake they.<br> May all in whom rest splendour and great riches obtain refreshment in these sacrifices.<br> 13 We will rejoice to drink the tenfold present when the twicefive come bearing sacred viands.<br> What can he do whose steeds and reins are choicest? These, the all-potent, urge brave men to conquest.<br> 14 The sea and all the Deities shall give us him with the golden ear and neck bejewelled.<br> Dawns, hasting to the praises of the pious, be pleased with us, both offerers and singers.<br> 15 Four youthful sons of Ma&#347;ar&#347;&#257;ra vex me, three, of the king, the conquering Ayavasa.<br> Now like the Sun, O Varu&#7751;a and Mitra, your car hath shone, long-shaped and reined with splendour.</p>
