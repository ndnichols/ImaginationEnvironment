<p>1. WHEN thou, O Sun, this day, arising sinless, shalt speak the truth to Varu&#7751;a and Mitra,<br> O Aditi, may all the Deities love us, and thou, O Aryaman, while we are singing.<br> 2 Looking on man, O Varu&#7751;a and Mitra, this Sun ascendeth up by both the pathways,<br> Guardian of all things fixt, of all that moveth, beholding good and evil acts of mortals.<br> 3 He from their home hath yoked the Seven gold Coursers who, dropping oil and fatness, carry S&#363;rya.<br> Yours, Varu&#7751;a and Mitra, he surveyeth the worlds and living creatures like a herdsman.<br> 4 Your coursers rich in store of sweets have mounted: to the bright ocean S&#363;rya hath ascended,<br> For whom the &#256;dityas make his pathway ready, Aryaman, Mitra, Varu&#7751;a, accordant.<br> 5 For these, even Aryaman, Varu&#7751;a and Mitra, are the chastisers of all guile and falsehood.<br> These, Aditi's Sons, infallible and mighty, have waxen in the home of law Eternal.<br> 6 These, Mitra, Varu&#7751;a whom none deceiveth, with great power quicken even the fool to wisdom,<br> And, wakening, moreover, thoughtful insight, lead it by easy paths o&#146;er grief and trouble.<br> 7 They ever vigilant, with eyes that close not, caring for heaven and earth, lead on the thoughtless.<br> Even in the river's bed there is a shallow. across this broad expanse may they conduct us.<br> 8 When Aditi and Varu&#7751;a and Mitra, like guardians, give Sud&#257;s their friendly shelter,<br> Granting him sons and lineal succession, let us not, bold ones! move the Gods to anger.<br> 9 May he with ofierings purify the altar from any stains of Varu&#7751;a's reviler.<br> Aryaman save us us all those who hate us: give room and freedom to Sud&#257;s, ye Mighty.<br> 10 Hid from our eyes is their resplendent meeting: by their mysterious might they hold dominion.<br> Heroes! we cry trembling in fear before you, even in the greatness of your power have mercy.<br> 11 He who wins favour for his prayer by worship, that he may gain him strength and highest riches,<br> That good man's mind the Mighty Ones will follow: they have brought comfort to his spacious dwelling.<br> 12 This priestly task, Gods! Varu&#7751;a and Mitra! hath been performed for you at sacrifices.<br> Convey us safely over every peril. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
