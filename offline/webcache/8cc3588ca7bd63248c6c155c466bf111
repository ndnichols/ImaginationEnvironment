<TD><P>After these things YAHSHUA went over the sea of Galilee, which is the    
sea of Tiberias.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he   
did on them that were diseased.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4> 
3</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA went up into a mountain, and there he sat with    
his disciples.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>
And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>When YAHSHUA then lifted up his     
eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall 
we buy bread, that these may eat?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6>   
<H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what   
he would do.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for      
them, that every one of them may take a little.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's    
brother, saith unto him,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small   
fishes: but what are they among so many?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA said, Make the men sit down. Now    
there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five    
thousand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And YAHSHUA took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to    
the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of    
the fishes as much as they would.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12>  
<H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>When they were filled, he said unto his disciples,       
Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore they gathered them      
together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley       
loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Then those men, when they 
had seen the miracle that YAHSHUA did, said, This is of a truth that prophet    
that should come into the world.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15>   
<H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>When YAHSHUA therefore perceived that they would come    
and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain    
himself alone.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And entered into a   
ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and YAHSHUA  
was not come to them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>So when they had rowed    
about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see YAHSHUA walking on the sea,  
and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>But he saith unto them, It is I;  
be not afraid.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was 
at the land whither they went.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4> 
22</H4></TD><TD><P>The day following, when the people which stood on the other  
side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one         
whereinto his disciples were entered, and that YAHSHUA went not with his        
disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>(Howbeit there came  
other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after   
that the ADONAY had given thanks:)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24> 
<H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>When the people therefore saw that YAHSHUA was not       
there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum,   
seeking for YAHSHUA.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said 
unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA answered them and said, Verily, verily, 
I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did 
eat of the loaves, and were filled.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27>
<H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that    
meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto 
you: for him hath ELOHIYM the Father sealed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that 
we might work the works of ELOHIYM?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29>
<H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA answered and said unto them, This is the work of 
ELOHIYM, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>They said therefore unto him,     
What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou  
work?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>Our    
fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from  
heaven to eat.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>Then YAHSHUA said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you  
not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from        
heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>For  
the bread of ELOHIYM is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto  
the world.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Then said they unto him, ADONAY, evermore give us this bread.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA said unto them, I 
am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that      
believeth on me shall never thirst.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36>
<H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and      
believe not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>
All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I     
will in no wise cast out.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>      
38</H4></TD><TD><P>For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but    
the will of him that sent me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>  
39</H4></TD><TD><P>And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of    
all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again  
at the last day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the 
Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up   
at the last day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which     
came down from heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And they said, Is not this YAHSHUA, the son of Joseph, whose father 
and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA         
therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>No man can come to   
me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at   
the last day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of YHVH. Every   
man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto      
me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46><H4>46</H4></TD><TD><P>Not that 
any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of ELOHIYM, he hath seen the     
Father.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>47</H4></TD><TD><P>     
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting        
life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V48><H4>48</H4></TD><TD><P>I am   
that bread of life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V49><H4>49</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V50><H4>50</H4></TD><TD><P>This is the bread which   
cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V51><H4>51</H4></TD><TD><P>I am the living bread     
which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for    
ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the     
life of the world.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V52><H4>52</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man     
give us his flesh to eat?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V53><H4>      
53</H4></TD><TD><P>Then YAHSHUA said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, 
Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life 
in you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V54><H4>54</H4></TD><TD><P>     
Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will     
raise him up at the last day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V55><H4>  
55</H4></TD><TD><P>For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink           
indeed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V56><H4>56</H4></TD><TD><P>He   
that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V57><H4>57</H4></TD><TD><P>As the living   
Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he    
shall live by me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V58><H4>58</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did  
eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V59><H4>59</H4></TD><TD><P>These things    
said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V60><H4>60</H4></TD><TD><P>Many therefore of his disciples,  
when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V61><H4>61</H4></TD><TD><P>When YAHSHUA    
knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this 
offend you?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V62><H4>62</H4></TD><TD><P> 
What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V63><H4>63</H4></TD><TD><P>It is the spirit     
that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you,  
they are spirit, and they are life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V64>
<H4>64</H4></TD><TD><P>But there are some of you that believe not. For YAHSHUA  
knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray  
him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V65><H4>65</H4></TD><TD><P>And he  
said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were   
given unto him of my Father.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V66><H4>   
66</H4></TD><TD><P>From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked   
no more with him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V67><H4>67</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Then said YAHSHUA unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V68><H4>68</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Simon Peter answered 
him, ADONAY, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V69><H4>69</H4></TD><TD><P>And we believe and

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V70><H4>70</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA answered them,    
Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD
