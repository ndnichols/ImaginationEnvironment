ELOHIYM, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the  
fathers by the prophets,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath

<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Who being the brightness of his 
glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the     
word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the      
right hand of the Majesty on high:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4>

But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O ELOHIYM, is for ever and ever: a       
sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD
