1</H4></TD><TD><P>A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of  
death than the day of one's birth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2>  
<H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go   
to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will   
lay it to his heart.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance    
the heart is made better.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of 
fools is in the house of mirth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4> 
5</H4></TD><TD><P>It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man   
to hear the song of fools.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4>
</TD><TD><P>For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of   
the fool: this also is vanity.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>  
7</H4></TD><TD><P>Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift           
destroyeth the heart.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient 
in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for    
anger resteth in the bosom of fools.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Say not thou, What is the cause that the former 
days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning        
this.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Wisdom 
is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the     
sun.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>For     
wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge    
is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Consider the work of ELOHIYM: for 
who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>In the day of prosperity be       
joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: ELOHIYM also hath set the one     
over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>All things have 
I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his      
righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his        
wickedness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou  
destroy thyself ?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die 
before thy time?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this    
withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth ELOHIYM shall come forth of them   
all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Wisdom  
strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>For there is not a   
just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Also take no heed unto all words  
that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>For oftentimes also thine own     
heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>All this have I proved by     
wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>That which is far off, and        
exceeding deep, who can find it out?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>I applied mine heart to know, and to search,    
and to seek out wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of 
folly, even of foolishness and madness:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And I find more bitter than death the woman,    
whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth ELOHIYM  
shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>Behold, this have I found,    
saith the preacher, counting one by one, to find out the account:</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Which yet my soul         
seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman     
among all those have I not found.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29>  
<H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Lo, this only have I found, that ELOHIYM hath made man   
upright; but they have sought out many inventions.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
