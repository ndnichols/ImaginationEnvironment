Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of           
witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily      
beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Looking unto YAHSHUA   
the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him   
endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of    
the throne of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against 
himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye have not yet resisted unto       
blood, striving against sin.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>    
5</H4></TD><TD><P>And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you 
as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of YHVH, nor faint    
when thou art rebuked of him:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>   
6</H4></TD><TD><P>For whom YHVH loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son   
whom he receiveth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>If ye endure chastening, ELOHIYM dealeth with you as with sons; for what 
son is he whom the father chasteneth not?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all    
are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Furthermore we have had fathers of  
our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much     
rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>For they verily for a few     
days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we      
might be partakers of his holiness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11>
<H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous,  
but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of         
righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore lift up the hands which 
hang down, and the feeble knees;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13>   
<H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which   
is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Follow peace with all men,    
and holiness, without which no man shall see YHVH:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Looking diligently lest any man   
fail of the grace of ELOHIYM; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble  
you, and thereby many be defiled;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16>  
<H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as      
Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>For ye know how that afterward,   
when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no     
place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>For ye are not come unto the  
mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and 
darkness, and tempest,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice     
they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any        
more:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>(For   
they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch 
the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And so terrible was the   
sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>But ye are come unto mount Sion,  
and unto the city of the living EL, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an           
innumerable company of angels,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4> 
23</H4></TD><TD><P>To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which   
are written in heaven, and to ELOHIYM the Judge of all, and to the spirits of   
just men made perfect,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And to YAHSHUA the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood   
of sprinkling, that speaketh better things that that of Abel.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>See that ye refuse not him    
that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth,     
much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from      
heaven:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>     
Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once    
more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And this word, Yet once more,     
signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are  
made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore we receiving a kingdom  
which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve ELOHIYM          
acceptably with reverence and godly fear:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A
