<TD><P>Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius       
Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his   
brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and        
Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2>   
<H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of    
ELOHIYM came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And he came into all the        
country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of  
sins;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>As it is 
written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying, The voice of    
one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of YHVH, make his paths        
straight.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>     
Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; 
and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made        
smooth;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
all flesh shall see the salvation of YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said he to the multitude that came forth to  
be baptized of him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from    
the wrath to come?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say  
within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, That      
ELOHIYM is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And now also the axe is     
laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not forth  
good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And the people asked him, saying, 
What shall we do then?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him   
impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Then came also  
publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do?</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto     
them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And the soldiers likewise         
demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Do        
violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your        
wages.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of John,   
whether he were the MASHIYACH, or not;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed   
baptize you with water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose    
shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and  
with fire:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and will       
gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn with fire          
unquenchable.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>But Herod the   
tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip's wife, and for 
all the evils which Herod had done,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20>
<H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in        
prison.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Now  
when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that YAHSHUA also being     
baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily     
shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art  
my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A
