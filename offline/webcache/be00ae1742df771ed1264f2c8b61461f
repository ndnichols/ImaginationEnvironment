<p>1. Burn him not up, nor quite consume him, Agni: let not his body or his skin be scattered.<br> O J&#257;tavedas, when thou hast matured him, then send him on his way unto the Fathers.<br> 2 When thou hast made him ready, J&#257;tavedas, then do thou give him over to the Fathers.<br> When he attains unto the life that waits him, he shall become the Deities' controller.<br> 3 The Sun receive thine eye, tne Wind thy spirit; go, as thy merit is, to earth or heaven.<br> Go, if it be thy lot, unto the waters; go, make thine home in plants with all thy members.<br> 4 Thy portion is the goat: with heat consume him: let thy fierce flame, thy glowing splendour, burn him<br> With thine auspicious forms, o J&#257;tavedas, bear this man to the region of the pious.<br> 5 Again, O Agni, to the Fathers send him who, offered in thee, goes with our oblations.<br> Wearing new life let him increase his offspring: let him rejoin a body, J&#257;tavedas.<br> 6 What wound soe&#146;er the dark bird hath inflicted, the emmet, or the serpent, or the jackal,<br> May Agni who devoureth all things heal it and Soma who hath passed into the Brahmans.<br> 7 Shield thee with flesh against the flames of Agni, encompass thee about with fat and marrow,<br> So will the Bold One, eager to attack thee with fierce glow fail to girdle and consume thee.<br> 8 Forbear, O Agni, to upset this ladle: the Gods and they who merit Soma love it.<br> This ladle, this which serves the Gods to drink from, in this the Immortal Deities rejoice them.<br> 9 1 send afar flesh eating Agni, bearing off stains may he depart to Yama's subjects.<br> But let this other J&#257;tavedas carry oblation to the Gods, for he is skilful.<br> 10 I choose as God for Father-worship Agni, flesh-eater, who hath past within your dwelling,<br> While looking on this other J&#257;tavedas. Let him light flames in the supreme assembly.<br> 11 With offerings meet let Agni bring the Fathers who support the Law.<br> Let him announce oblations paid to Fathers and to Deities.<br> 12 Right gladly would we set thee down, right gladly make thee burn and glow.<br> Gladly bring yearning Fathers nigh to cat the food of sacrifice.<br> 13 Cool, Agni, and again refresh the spot which thou hast scorched and burnt.<br> Here let the water-lily grow, and tender grass and leafy herb.<br> 14 O full of coolness, thou cool Plant, full of fresh moisture, freshening Herb,<br> Come hither with the female frog: fill with delight this Agni here.</p>
