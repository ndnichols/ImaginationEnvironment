<TD><P>Set the trumpet to thy mouth. He shall come as an eagle against the      
house of YHVH, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed       
against my law.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Israel shall cry unto me, My ELOHIYM, we know thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

is good: the enemy shall pursue him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4>
<H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made     
princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them  
idols, that they may be cut off.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>

kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency?</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>For from Israel was it 
also: the workman made it; therefore it is not ELOHIYM: but the calf of Samaria 
shall be broken in pieces.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4>
</TD><TD><P>For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it  
hath no stalk; the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers    
shall swallow it up.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD>

wherein is no pleasure.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself:       
Ephraim hath hired lovers.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>     
10</H4></TD><TD><P>Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I

princes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>

sin.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>I have

thing.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>They  
sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat it; but YHVH

they shall return to Egypt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>

and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his        
cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This
