them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore when thou    
doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in   
the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I    
say unto you, They have their reward.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

know what thy right hand doeth:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>

in secret himself shall reward thee openly.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the   
hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the     
corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you,    
They have their reward.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou   
hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which 
seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as    
the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much          
speaking.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Be   
not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have    
need of, before ye ask him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>

will also forgive you:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4>

Father forgive your trespasses.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>
16</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad   
countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to   
fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

anoint thine head, and wash thy face;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

<TD><P>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth 
corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>But lay up for yourselves

thieves do not break through nor steal:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

heart be also.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy      
whole body shall be full of light.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23> 
<H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full   
of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is   
that darkness!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the  
other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve  
ELOHIYM and mammon.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall   
eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is    
not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>Behold the fowls of the air: for  
they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly    
Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>Which of you by taking thought    
can add one cubit unto his stature?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28>
<H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies 
of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And yet I say unto you,   
That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore, if        
ELOHIYM so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is     
cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore take  
no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal 
shall we be clothed?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your         
heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>But seek ye first the kingdom 
of EL, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>Take therefore  
no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of  
itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
