<TD><P>Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of YAHSHUA MASHIYACH, to them that 
have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of ELOHIYM  
and our Saviour YAHSHUA MASHIYACH:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2>  
<H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the        
knowledge of ELOHIYM, and of YAHSHUA our ADONAY,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>According as his divine power hath  
given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the      
knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Whereby are given unto us exceeding 
great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine  
nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And beside this,  
giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And to knowledge  
temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And to godliness brotherly  
kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>For if these things be in you, and abound, they   
make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our 
ADONAY YAHSHUA MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, 
and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore the rather, brethren,   
give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these       
things, ye shall never fall:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>   
11</H4></TD><TD><P>For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly   
into the everlasting kingdom of our ADONAY and Saviour YAHSHUA MASHIYACH.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore I     
will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though  
ye know them, and be established in the present truth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Yea, I think it meet, as long as  
I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Knowing that shortly 
I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our ADONAY YAHSHUA MASHIYACH hath    
shewed me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these    
things always in remembrance.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>  
16</H4></TD><TD><P>For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we   
made known unto you the power and coming of our ADONAY YAHSHUA MASHIYACH, but   
were eyewitnesses of his majesty.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17>  
<H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>For he received from ELOHIYM the Father honour and       
glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my 
beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And this voice which came from heaven we heard, 
when we were with him in the holy mount.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>We have also a more sure word of prophecy;      
whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark  
place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Knowing this first, that  
no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>For the prophecy came not in  
old time by the will of man: but holy men of ELOHIYM spake as they were moved   
by the Holy Ghost.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by
