<p>1. I WITH my lips have fashioned for this Hero words never matched, most plentiful and auspicious,<br> For him the Ancient, Great, Strong, Energetic, the very mighty Wielder of the Thunder.<br> 2 Amid the sages, with the Sun he brightened the Parents: glorified, he burst the mountain;<br> And, roaring with the holy-thoughted singers, he loosed the bond that held the beams of Morning.<br> 3 Famed for great deeds, with priests who kneel and laud him, he still hath conquered in the frays for cattle,<br> And broken down the forts, the Fort-destroyer, a Friend with friends, a Sage among the sages.<br> 4 Come with thy girthed mares, with abundant vigour and plenteous strength to him who sings thy praises.<br> Come hither, borne by mares with many heroes, Lover of song! Steer! for the people's welfare.<br> 5 Indra with rush and might, sped by his Coursers, hath swiftly won the waters from the southward.<br> Thus set at liberty the rivers daily flow to their goal, incessant and exhaustless.</p>
