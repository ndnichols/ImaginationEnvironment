<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Because thou hast had a         
perpetual hatred, and hast shed the blood of the children of Israel by the      
force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time that their        
iniquity had an end:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD>

shall pursue thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD>
