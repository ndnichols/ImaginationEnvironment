ELOHIYM came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou

<P>Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is

this.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And      
ELOHIYM said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the

Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all  
these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that 
thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds     
unto me that ought not to be done.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10> 
<H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that

is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my      
mother; and she became my wife.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>

my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt  
show unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my         
brother.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave
