<p>1. MOUNTED upon thy chariot-seat approach us: thine is the Soma-draught from days aforetime.<br> Loose for the sacred grass thy dear companions. These men who bring oblation call thee hither.<br> 2 Come our true Friend, passing by many people; come with thy two Bay Steeds to our devotions;<br> For these our hymns are calling thee, O Indra, hymns formed for praise, soliciting thy friendship.<br> 3 Pleased, with thy Bay Steeds, Indra, God, come quickly to this our sacrifice that heightens worship;<br> For with my thoughts, presenting oil to feed thee, I call thee to the feast of sweet libations.<br> 4 Yea, let thy two Bay Stallions bear thee hither, well limbed and good to draw, thy dear companions.<br> Pleased with the corn-blent offering which we bring thee, may Indra, Friend, hear his friend's adoration.<br> 5 Wilt thou not make me guardian of the people, make me, impetuous Maghavan, their ruler?<br> Make me a &#7770;&#7779;i having drunk of Soma? Wilt thou not give me wealth that lasts for ever?<br> 6 Yoked to thy chariot, led thy tall Bays, Indra, companions of thy banquet, bear thee hither,<br> Who from of old press to heaven's farthest limits, the Bull's impetuous and well-groomed Horses.<br> 7 Drink of the strong pressed out by strong ones, Indra, that which the Falcon brought thee when thou longedst;<br> In whose wild joy thou stirrest up the people, in whose wild joy thou didst unbar the cow-stalls.<br> 8 Call we on Indra, Makhavan, auspicious, best Hero in the fight where spoil is gathered;<br> The Strong, who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the V&#7771;tras, wins and gathers riches.</p>
