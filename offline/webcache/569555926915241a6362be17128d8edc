<TD><P>In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the month, came    
the word of YHVH by the prophet Haggai, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel,  
governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to   
the residue of the people, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3>  
<H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Who is left among you that saw this house in her first    
glory? and how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as  
nothing?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Yet   
now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith YHVH; and be strong, O Joshua, son of        
Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith      
YHVH, and work: for I am with you, saith YHVH of hosts:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>According to the word that I        
covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among     
you: fear ye not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD>
<P>For thus saith YHVH of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I will     
shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will shake all        
nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house   
with glory, saith YHVH of hosts.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>
8</H4></TD><TD><P>The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith YHVH of       
hosts.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>The     
glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith YHVH of   
hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith YHVH of hosts.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>In the four and twentieth 
day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of YHVH by  
Haggai the prophet, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>    
11</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus saith YHVH of hosts; Ask now the priests concerning the 
law, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>
If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch 
bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the      
priests answered and said, No.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4> 
13</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body      
touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It  
shall be unclean.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is this nation 
before me, saith YHVH; and so is every work of their hands; and that which they 
offer there is unclean.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before 
a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of YHVH:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Since those days were, when one   
came to an heap of twenty measures, there were but ten: when one came to the    
pressfat for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but         
twenty.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>I    
smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labours of     
your hands; yet ye turned not to me, saith YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Consider now from this day and    
upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day   
that the foundation of YHVH's temple was laid, consider it.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Is the seed yet in the barn?  
yea, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive      
tree, hath not brought forth: from this day will I bless you.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And again the word of YHVH    
came unto Haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month, saying,</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Speak to Zerubbabel, 
governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth;</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will overthrow the  
throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the      
heathen; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and    
the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his      
brother.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>In  
that day, saith YHVH of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the  
son of Shealtiel, saith YHVH, and will make thee as a signet: for I have chosen 
thee, saith YHVH of hosts.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright
