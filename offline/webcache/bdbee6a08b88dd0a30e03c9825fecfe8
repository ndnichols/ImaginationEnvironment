Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down    
before the house of ELOHIYM, there assembled unto him out of Israel a very      
great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very      
sore.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And      
Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto   
Ezra, We have trespassed against our ELOHIYM, and have taken strange wives of   
the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this         
thing.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Now     
therefore let us make a covenant with our ELOHIYM to put away all the wives,    
and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those 
that tremble at the commandment of our ELOHIYM; and let it be done according to 
the law.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>      
Arise; for this matter belongeth unto thee: we also will be with thee: be of    
good courage, and do it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all   
Israel, to swear that they should do according to this word. And they sware.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Ezra rose up 
from before the house of ELOHIYM, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son  
of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water:    
for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried       
away.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And they 
made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the   
captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And that whosoever     
would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and   
the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from   
the congregation of those that had been carried away.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Then all the men of Judah and       
Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within three days. It was  
the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in   
the street of the house of ELOHIYM, trembling because of this matter, and for   
the great rain.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressed, and  
have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Now therefore make confession 
unto YHVH ELOHIYM of your fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves 
from the people of the land, and from the strange wives.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Then all the congregation         
answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said, so must we do.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>But the people are   
many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without,      
neither is this a work of one day or two: for we are many that have             
transgressed in this thing.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>    
14</H4></TD><TD><P>Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let    
all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times,  
and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the       
fierce wrath of our ELOHIYM for this matter be turned from us.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Only Jonathan the son of      
Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this matter: and      
Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

did so. And Ezra the priest, with certain chief of the fathers, after the house 
of their fathers, and all of them by their names, were separated, and sat down  
in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD
