<p>1. THIS, singer, is my firm determination, to aid the worshipper who pours the Soma.<br> I slay the man who brings no milkoblation, unrighteous, powerful, the truth's perverter.<br> 2 Then Will I, when I lead my friends to battle against the radiant persons of the godless,<br> Prepare for thee at home a vigorous bullock, and pour for thee the fifteen-fold strong juices.<br> 3 I know not him who sayeth and declareth that he hath slain the godless in the battle.<br> Soon as they see the furious combat raging, men speak forth praises of my vigorous horses.<br> 4 While yet my deeds of might were unrecorded, all passed for Maghavans though I existed.<br> The potent one who dwelt in peace I conquered, grasped by the foot and slew him on the mountain.<br> 5 None hinder me in mine heroic exploits, no, not the mountains when I will and purpose.<br> Even the deaf will tremble at my roaring, and every day will dust be agitated.<br> 6 To see the Indraless oblation-drinkers, mean offerers, o&#146;ertaken by destruction!<br> Then shall the fellies of my car pass over those who have blamed my joyous Friend and scorned him.<br> 7 Thou wast, thou grewest to full vital vigour: an earlier saw, a later one shall see thee.<br> Two canopies, as &#146;twere, are round about him who reacheth to the limit of this region.<br> 8 The freed kine eat the barley of the pious. 1 saw them as they wandered with the herdsman.<br> The calling of the pious rang around them. What portion will these kine afford their owner?<br> 9 When we who cat the grass of men are gathered I am with barley-eaters in the corn-land.<br> There shall the captor yoke the yokeless bullock, and he who hath been yoked seek one to loose him.<br> 10 There wilt thou hold as true my spoken purpose, to bring together quadrupeds. and bipeds.<br> I will divide, without a fight, his riches who warreth here, against the Bull, with women.<br> 11 When a man's daughter hath been ever eyeless, who, knowing, will be wroth with her for blindness?<br> Which of the two will loose on him his anger-the man who leads her home or he who woos her?<br> 12 How many a maid is pleasing to the suitor who fain would marry for her splendid riches?<br> If the girl be both good and fair of feature, she finds, herself, a friend among the people.<br> 13 His feet have grasped: he eats the man who meets him. Around his head he sets the head for shelter.<br> Sitting anear and right above he smites us, and follows earth that lies spread out beneath him.<br> 14 High, leafless, shadowless, and swift is Heaven: the Mother stands, the Youngling, loosed, is feeding.<br> Loud hath she lowed, licking Another's offspring. In what world hath the Cow laid down her udder?<br> 15 Seven heroes from the nether part ascended, and from the upper part came eight together.<br> Nine from behind came armed with winnowing-baskets: ten from the front pressed o&#146;er the rock's high ridges.<br> 16 One of the ten, the tawny, shared in common, they send to execute their final purpose.<br> The Mother carries on her breast the Infant of noble form and soothes it while it knows not.<br> 17 The Heroes dressed with fire the fatted wether: the dice were thrown by way of sport and gaming.<br> Two reach the plain amid the heavenly waters, hallowing and with means of purifying.<br> 18 Crying aloud they ran in all directions: One half of them will cook, and not the other.<br> To me hath Savitar, this God, declared it: He will perform, whose food is wood and butter.<br> 19 I saw a troop advancing from the distance moved, not by wheels but their own God-like nature.<br> The Friendly One seeks human generations, destroying, still new bands of evil beings.<br> 20 These my two Bulls, even Pramara's, are harnessed: drive them not far; here let them often linger.<br> The waters even shall aid him to his object, and the all-cleansing Sun who is above us.<br> 21 This is the thunderbolt which often whirleth down from the lofty misty realm of S&#363;rya.<br> Beyond this realm there is another glory so through old age they pass and feel no sorrow.<br> 22 Bound fast to,every tree the cow is lowing, and thence the man-consuming birds are flying,<br> Then all this world, though pressing juice for Indra and strengthening the &#7770;&#7779;i, is affrighted.<br> 23 In the Gods&#146; mansion stood the first-created, and from their separation came the later.<br> Three warm the Earth while holding stores of water, and Two of these convey the murmuring moisture.<br> 24 This is thy life: and do thou mark and know it. As such, hide not thyself in time of battle.<br> He manifests the light and hides the vapour: his foot is never free from robes that veil it.</p>
