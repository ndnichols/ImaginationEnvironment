</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>It is not         
expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of  
the ADONAY.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>I  
knew a man in MASHIYACH above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I       
cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: ELOHIYM knoweth;) such  
an one caught up to the third heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or   
out of the body, I cannot tell: ELOHIYM knoweth;)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>How that he was caught up into      
paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to      
utter.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Of such 
an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine                
infirmities.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>  
For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the   
truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he   
seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And lest I should be exalted above measure        
through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the  
flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above      
measure.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>For   
this thing I besought YHVH thrice, that it might depart from me.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto me, My     
grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most 
gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of       
MASHIYACH may rest upon me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>    
10</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in  
necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for MASHIYACH's sake: for when I am 
weak, then am I strong.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought   
to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest     
apostles, though I be nothing.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4> 
12</H4></TD><TD><P>Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all  
patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>For what is it wherein ye were    
inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to    
you? forgive me this wrong.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>    
14</H4></TD><TD><P>Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will 
not be burdensome to you: for I seek not your's but you: for the children ought 
not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will very gladly    
spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I   
be loved.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>   
But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you    
with guile.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>I desired Titus, and with him 
I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same       
spirit? walked we not in the same steps?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto   
you? we speak before ELOHIYM in MASHIYACH: but we do all things, dearly         
beloved, for your edifying.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>    
20</H4></TD><TD><P>For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as  
I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be 
debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings,        
tumults:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
lest, when I come again, my EL will humble me among you, and that I shall       
bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness 
and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.</P></TD></TR>
