1</H4></TD><TD><P>They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him,    
and become another man's, shall he return unto her again? shall not that land   
be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet      
return again to me, saith YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>

hast not been lien with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in  
the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy 
wickedness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter rain; 
and thou hadst a whore's forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Wilt thou not from this

<P>YHVH said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen that   
which backsliding Israel hath done? she is gone up upon every high mountain and 
under every green tree, and there hath played the harlot.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And I said after she had done all   
these things, Turn thou unto me. But she returned not. And her treacherous      
sister Judah saw it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed  
adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet her           
treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to    
pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that she defiled the land, and      
committed adultery with stones and with stocks.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And yet for all this her treacherous sister  
Judah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith        
YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
YHVH said unto me, The backsliding Israel hath justified herself more than      
treacherous Judah.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD>

backsliding Israel, saith YHVH; and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon    
you: for I am merciful, saith YHVH, and I will not keep anger for ever.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Only acknowledge     
thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against YHVH thy ELOHIYM, and hast

obeyed my voice, saith YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>

multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, saith YHVH, they shall say 
no more, The ark of the covenant of YHVH: neither shall it come to mind:        
neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit it; neither shall that 
be done any more.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD>
