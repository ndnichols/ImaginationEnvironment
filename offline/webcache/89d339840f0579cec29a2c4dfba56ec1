that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of      
records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And it was found written, that  
Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the   
keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And the king said, What     
honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king's    
servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And the king said, Who is   
in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king's house, to 
speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for    
him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And the

king said, Let him come in.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>

done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought in his  
heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself?</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And Haman answered the 
king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Let the royal apparel be brought    
which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the  
crown royal which is set upon his head:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And let this apparel and horse be delivered to    
the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man   
withal whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on horseback through   
the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the   
man whom the king delighteth to honour.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and    
take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai   
the Jew, that sitteth at the king's gate: let nothing fail of all that thou     
hast spoken.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>
Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought    
him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him,     
Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And Mordecai came    
again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having    
his head covered.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had  
befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai  
be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not 
prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And while they were yet talking   
with him, came the king's chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the      
banquet that Esther had prepared.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
