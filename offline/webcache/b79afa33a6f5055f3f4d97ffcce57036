<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>And Hezekiah sent to all Israel 
and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should     
come to the house of YHVH at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto YHVH ELOHIYM  
of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>For 
the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in        
Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>For they could not keep it at that  
time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither   
had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And the thing pleased the king and  
all the congregation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD>
<TD><P>So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, 
from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto     
YHVH ELOHIYM of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done it of a long time in 
such sort as it was written.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>    
6</H4></TD><TD><P>So the posts went with the letters from the king and his      
princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of    
the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto YHVH ELOHIYM of        
Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are  
escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And be not ye like your fathers,    
and like your brethren, which trespassed against YHVH ELOHIYM of their fathers, 
who therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your  
fathers were, but yield yourselves unto YHVH, and enter into his sanctuary,     
which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve YHVH your ELOHIYM, that the        
fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>For if ye turn again unto YHVH, your brethren  
and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive, so  
that they shall come again into this land: for YHVH your ELOHIYM is gracious    
and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto       
him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>So the  
posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even 
unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Nevertheless divers of Asher  
and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Also in Judah the    
hand of ELOHIYM was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king    
and of the princes, by the word of YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to 
keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great            
congregation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the  
altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Then they killed the 
passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the     
Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt       
offerings into the house of YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16>  
<H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And they stood in their place after their manner,        
according to the law of Moses the man of ELOHIYM: the priests sprinkled the     
blood, which they received of the hand of the Levites.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>For there were many in the        
congregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of  
the killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them 
unto YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>  
For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar,    
and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover         
otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good   
YHVH pardon every one</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>That prepareth his heart to seek ELOHIYM, YHVH ELOHIYM of his       
fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the         
sanctuary.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And YHVH hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And the children of Israel that   
were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with    
great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised YHVH day by day,        
singing with loud instruments unto YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the     
Levites that taught the good knowledge of YHVH: and they did eat throughout the 
feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to YHVH       
ELOHIYM of their fathers.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>      
23</H4></TD><TD><P>And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven      
days: and they kept other seven days with gladness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>For Hezekiah king of Judah did    
give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the  
princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep:    
and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And all the congregation of       
Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out 
of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that      
dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>      
26</H4></TD><TD><P>So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of   
Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the        
priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard,    
and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place, even unto heaven.</P></TD>
