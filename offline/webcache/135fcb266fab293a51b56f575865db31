<p>1. VENOMOUS, slightly venomous, or venomous aquatic worm,&#151;<br> Both creatures, stinging, unobserved, with poison have infected me.<br> 2 Coming, it kills the unobserved; it kills them as it goes away,<br> It kills them as it drives them off, and bruising bruises them to death.<br> 3 Sara grass, Darbha, Ku&#347;ara, and Sairya, Mu&ntilde;ja, V&#299;ra&#7751;a,<br> Where all these creatures dwell unseen, with poison have infected me.<br> 4 The cows had settled in their stalls, the beasts of prey had sought their lairs,<br> Extinguished were the lights of men, when things unseen infected me.<br> 5 Or these, these reptiles, are observed, like lurking thieves at evening time.<br> Seers of all, themselves unseen: be therefore very vigilant.<br> 6 Heaven is your Sire, your Mother Earth, Soma your Brother, Aditi<br> Your Sister: seeing all, unseen, keep still and dwell ye happily.<br> 7 Biters of shoulder or of limb, with needle-stings, most venomous,<br> Unseen, whatever ye may be, vanish together and be gone.<br> 8 Slayer of things unseen, the Sun, beheld of all, mounts, eastward, up,<br> Consuming all that are not seen, and evil spirits of the night.<br> 9 There hath the Sun-God mounted up, who scorches much and everything.<br> Even the &#256;ditya from the hills, all-seen, destroying things unseen.<br> 10 I hang the poison in the Sun, a wine-skin in a vintner's house,<br> He will not die, nor shall we die: his path is far: he whom Bay Horses bear hath turned thee to sweet meath.<br> 11 This little bird, so very small, hath swallowed all thy poison up.<br> She will not die, nor shall we die: his path is far: he whom Bay Horses bear hath turned thee to sweet meath.<br> 12 The three-times-seven bright sparks of fire have swallowed up the poison's strength.<br> They will not die, nor shall we die: his path is far: he whom Bay Horses bear hath turned thee to sweet meath.<br> 13 Of ninety rivers and of nine with power to stay the venom's course,&#151;<br> The names of all I have secured: his path is far: he whom Bay Horses bear hath turned thee to sweet meath.<br> 14 So have the peahens three-times-seven, so have the maiden Sisters Seven<br> Carried thy venom far away, as girls bear water in their jars.<br> 15 The poison-insect is so small; I crush the creature with a stone.<br> I turn the poison hence away, departed unto distant lands.<br> 16 Forth issuing from the mountain's side the poison-insect spake and said:<br> Scorpion, they venom is but weak.</p>
