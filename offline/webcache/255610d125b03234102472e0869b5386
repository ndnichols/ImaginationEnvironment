<p>I., HENCE sprinkle forth the juice effused,. Soma, the best of sacred gifts,<br> Who, friend of man, hath run amid the water-streams. He hath pressed Soma out with stones.<br> 2 Now, being purified, flow hither through the fleece inviolate and most odorous.<br> We ladden thee in waters when thou art effused, blending thee still with juice and milk.<br> 3 Pressed out for all to see, delighting Gods, Indu, Far-sighted One, is mental power.<br> 4 Cleansing thee, Soma, in thy stream, thou flowest in a watery robe:<br> Giver of wealth, thou sittest in the place of Law, O God, a fountain made of gold.<br> 5 Milking the heavenly udder for dear meath, he hath sat in the ancient gatheringplace.<br> Washed by the men, the Strong Farseeing One streams forth nutriti us food that all desire.<br> 6 O Soma, while they cleanse thee, dear and watchful in the sheep's long wool,<br> Thou hast become a Singer most like A&#7749;giras: thou madest S&#363;rya mount to heaven.<br> 7 Bountiful, best of furtherers, Soma floweth on, &#7770;&#7779;i and Singer, keen of sight.<br> Thou hast become a Sage most welcome to the Gods: thou madest S&#363;rya mount to heaven.<br> 8 Pressed out by pressers, Soma goes over the fleecy backs of sheep,<br> Goes, even as with a mare, in tawnycoloured stream, goes in exhilarating stream.<br> 9 Down to the water-Soma, rich in kine hath flowed with cows, with cows that have been milked.<br> They have approached the mixing-vessel as a sea: the cheerer streams for the carouse.<br> 10 Effused by stones, O Soma, and urged through the long wool of the sheep,<br> Thou, entering the saucers as a man the fort, gold-hued hast settled in the wood.<br> 11 He beautifies himself through the sheep's long fine wool, like an impetuous steed in war,<br> Even Soma Pavamana who shall be the joy of sages and of holy bards.<br> 12 O Soma,&#151;for the feast of Gods, river-like he hath swelled with surge,<br> With the stalk's juice, exhilarating, resting not, into the vat that drops with meath.<br> 13 Like a dear son who must be decked, the Lovely One hath clad him in a shining robe.<br> Men skilful at their work drive him forth, like a car, into the rivers from their bands.<br> 14 The living drops of Soma juice pour, as they flow, the gladdening drink,<br> Intelligent drops above the basin of the sea, exhilarating, finding light.<br> 15 May Pavamana, King and God, speed with his wave over the sea the lofty rite:<br> May he by Mitra's and by Varu&#7751;a's decree flow furthering the lofty rite.<br> 16 Far-seeing, lovely, guided by the men, the God whose home is in the sea-<br> 17 Soma, the gladdening juice, flows pressed for Indra with his Marut host:<br> He hastens o&#146;er the fleece with all his thousand streams: men make him bright and beautiful.<br> 18 Purified in the bowl and gendering the hymn, wise Soma joys among the Gods.<br> Robed in the flood, the Mighty One hath clad himself with milk and settled in the vats.<br> 19 O Soma, Indu, every day thy friendship hath been my delight.<br> Many fiends follow me; help me, thou Tawny-hued; pass on beyond these barriers.<br> 20 Close to thy bosom am I, Soma, day and night. O Tawny-hued, for friendship sake.<br> S&#363;rya himself refulgent with his glow have we o&#146;ertaken in his course like birds.<br> 21 Deft-handcd! thou when purified liftest thy voice amid the sea.<br> Thou, Pavamana, makest riches flow to us, yellow, abundant, much-desifed.<br> 22 Making thee pure and bright in the sheep's long wool, thou hast bellowed, steerlike, in the wood.<br> Thou flowest, Soma Pavamana, balmed with milk unto the special place of Gods.<br> 23 Flow on to win us strength, flow on to lofty lore of every kind.<br> Thou, Soma, as Exhilarator wast the first to spread the sea abroad for Gods.<br> 24 Flow to the realm of earth, flow to the realm of heaven, O Soma, in thy righteous ways.<br> Fair art thou whom the sages, O Far-seeing One, urge onward with their songs and hymns.<br> 25 Over the cleansing sieve have flowed the Pavamanas in a stream,<br> Girt by the Maruts, gladdening, Steeds with Indra's stiength, for wisdom and for dainty food.<br> 26 Urged onward by the pressers, clad in watery robes, Indu is speeding to the vat.<br> He gendering light, hath made the glad Cows low, while he takes them as his garb of state.</p>
