<TD><P>And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and there 
were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots; and he went up    
and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel     
into the city, and said unto him, Thus saith Benhadad,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Thy silver and thy gold is mine;    
thy wives also and thy children, even the goodliest, are mine.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And the king of Israel answered 
and said, My lord, O king, according to thy saying, I am thine, and all that I  
have.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And the  
messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Benhadad, saying, Although I     
have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold,    
and thy wives, and thy children;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>
6</H4></TD><TD><P>Yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this    
time, and they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and it 
shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in their 
hand, and take it away.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and      
said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he sent unto 
me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I 
denied him not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not unto him,   
nor consent.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my lord the king, All   
that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do: but this thing  
I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And Benhadad sent    
unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of       
Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And the king of      
Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him that girdeth on his harness     
boast himself as he that putteth it off.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this  
message, as he was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said    
unto his servants, Set yourselves in array. And they set themselves in array    
against the city.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus 
saith YHVH, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it  
into thine hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And Ahab said, By whom? And   
he said, Thus saith YHVH, Even by the young men of the princes of the           
provinces. Then he said, Who shall order the battle? And he answered, Thou.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Then he         
numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two       
hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the people, even all the 
children of Israel, being seven thousand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And they went out at noon. But Benhadad was     
drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two   
kings that helped him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first;   
and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of     
Samaria.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they   
be come out for war, take them alive.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>So these young men of the princes of the        
provinces came out of the city, and the army which followed them.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And they slew every one   
his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued them: and Benhadad the king   
of Syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And the king of Israel went out, and smote   
the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And the prophet came 
to the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and 
see what thou doest: for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come  
up against thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods are gods 
of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against    
them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And do this thing, Take the   
kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms:</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And number thee 
an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for    
chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be    
stronger than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass at    
the return of the year, that Benhadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to      
Aphek, to fight against Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>
27</H4></TD><TD><P>And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all       
present, and went against them: and the children of Israel pitched before them  
like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And there came a man 
of ELOHIYM, and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith YHVH,       
Because the Syrians have said, YHVH is ELOHIYM of the hills, but he is not      
ELOHIYM of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into  
thine hand, and ye shall know that I am YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And they pitched one over against the other  
seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and   
the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one   
day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>But the 
rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven  
thousand of the men that were left. And Benhadad fled, and came into the city,  
into an inner chamber.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the  
kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray thee, put       
sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of     
Israel: peradventure he will save thy life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and    
put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant 
Benhadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is   
my brother.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come from him, and   
did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy brother Benhadad. Then he said, Go ye, 
bring him. Then Benhadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into   
the chariot.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>
And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy father,  
I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father  
made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send thee away with this covenant. So   
he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And a certain man of the sons of the         
prophets said unto his neighbor in the word of YHVH, Smite me, I pray thee. And 
the man refused to smite him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>  
36</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the      
voice of YHVH, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay  
thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew       
him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>Then he 
found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, so   
that in smiting he wounded him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>
38</H4></TD><TD><P>So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, 
and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>And as the king passed by, he cried unto the 
king: and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and,      
behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: 
if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else     
thou shalt pay a talent of silver.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40> 
<H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. 
And the king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast    
decided it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel    
discerned him that he was of the prophets.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto him, Thus saith YHVH, Because  
thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction,   
therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>And the king of 
Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.</P></TD>
