Chapter 14</H1></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread:   
and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft,  
and put him to death.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD>
<TD><P>But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of the      
people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came 
a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she 
brake the box, and poured it on his head.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And there were some that had indignation within   
themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>For it might have been sold for 
more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they        
murmured against her.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And YAHSHUA said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a  
good work on me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them  
good: but me ye have not always.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>
8</H4></TD><TD><P>She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint 
my body to the burying.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached    
throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for 
a memorial of her.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to   
betray him unto them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him    
money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And the first day of unleavened   
bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt   
thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And he sendeth forth two of   
his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet   
you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And wheresoever he shall go in,   
say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the              
guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And he will shew you a    
large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And his disciples went    
forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they     
made ready the passover.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And as they sat and did eat,      
YAHSHUA said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall      
betray me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and    
another said, Is it I?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that   
dippeth with me in the dish.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>   
21</H4></TD><TD><P>The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but    
woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man   
if he had never been born.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>     
22</H4></TD><TD><P>And as they did eat, YAHSHUA took bread, and blessed, and    
brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And he took the cup, and  
when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto     
them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Verily I say unto    
you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink 
it new in the kingdom of EL.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>   
26</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount 
of Olives.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And YAHSHUA saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: 
for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be            
scattered.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>  
But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>But Peter said unto him,      
Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA saith unto him, Verily I say     
unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou  
shalt deny me thrice.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will 
not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And they came to a place which    
was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall 
pray.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And he 
taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to   
be very heavy;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye     
here, and watch.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that,   
if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, Abba, Father, all    
things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not     
what I will, but what thou wilt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37>   
<H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto 
Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>Watch ye and pray, lest ye    
enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>And again he    
went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he returned, he found    
them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to       
answer him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your  
rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into   
the hands of sinners.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>And immediately,     
while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great       
multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and    
the elders.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall     
kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P>And as soon as he was come, he    
goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46><H4>46</H4></TD><TD><P>And they laid their  
hands on him, and took him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>    
47</H4></TD><TD><P>And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a      
servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V48><H4>48</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA answered and said     
unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to  
take me?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V49><H4>49</H4></TD><TD><P>I   
was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the          
scriptures must be fulfilled.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V50><H4>  
50</H4></TD><TD><P>And they all forsook him, and fled.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V51><H4>51</H4></TD><TD><P>And there followed him a certain  
young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men    
laid hold on him:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V52><H4>52</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V53><H4>53</H4></TD><TD><P>And they led YAHSHUA away to  
the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the      
elders and the scribes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V54><H4>54</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high   
priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V55><H4>55</H4></TD><TD><P>And the chief        
priests and all the council sought for witness against YAHSHUA to put him to    
death; and found none.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V56><H4>56</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed   
not together.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V57><H4>57</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V58><H4>58</H4></TD><TD><P>We heard him say, I  
will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will  
build another made without hands.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V59>  
<H4>59</H4></TD><TD><P>But neither so did their witness agree together.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V60><H4>60</H4></TD><TD><P>And the high priest  
stood up in the midst, and asked YAHSHUA, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what  
is it which these witness against thee?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V61><H4>61</H4></TD><TD><P>But he held his peace, and answered nothing.    
Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the MASHIYACH, the 
Son of the Blessed?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V62><H4>62</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And YAHSHUA said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the   
right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V63><H4>63</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the high priest rent his     
clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V64><H4>64</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye have heard the blasphemy: what 
think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V65><H4>65</H4></TD><TD><P>And some began to spit on     
him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy:   
and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V66><H4>66</H4></TD><TD><P>And as Peter was beneath in   
the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V67><H4>67</H4></TD><TD><P>And when she saw Peter        
warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with YAHSHUA 
of Nazareth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V68><H4>68</H4></TD><TD><P>
But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And   
he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V69><H4>69</H4></TD><TD><P>And a maid saw him again, and began to say   
to them that stood by, This is one of them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V70><H4>70</H4></TD><TD><P>And he denied it again. And a little after,     
they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou   
art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V71><H4>71</H4></TD><TD><P>But he began to curse and to      
swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V72><H4>72</H4></TD><TD><P>And the second time the cock      
crew. And Peter called to mind the word that YAHSHUA said unto him, Before the  
cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he     
wept.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M. Hurt,
