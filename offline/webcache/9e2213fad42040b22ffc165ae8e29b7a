not remove.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>

YHVH to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow    
not among thorns.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD>
<P>Circumcise yourselves to YHVH, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye 
men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire,   
and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.</P></TD>

cities.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Set up 
the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will bring evil from the

it shall come to pass at that day, saith YHVH, that the heart of the king shall

that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within        
thee?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>For a

Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee; this is thy

bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart maketh a noise in me; I cannot

the alarm of war.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD>

the presence of YHVH, and by his fierce anger.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>For thus hath YHVH said, The whole land

VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>The whole city shall flee for the

art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with crimson,      
though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou rentest thy face   
with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; thy lovers will despise    
thee, they will seek thy life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4> 
31</H4></TD><TD><P>For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the   
anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the         
daughter of Zion, that bewaileth herself, that spreadeth her hands, saying, Woe 
is me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
