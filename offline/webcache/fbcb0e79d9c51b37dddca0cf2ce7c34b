<TD><P>Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned     
Abijam over Judah.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. and his mother's name was Maachah,  
the daughter of Abishalom.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done      
before him: and his heart was not perfect with YHVH his ELOHIYM, as the heart   
of David his father.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Nevertheless for David's sake did YHVH his ELOHIYM give him a lamp in    
Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem:</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Because David did that 
which was right in the eyes of YHVH, and turned not aside from any thing that   
he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the 
Hittite.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Now the rest of the    
acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the    
chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and          
Jeroboam.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and    
Asa his son reigned in his stead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9>   
<H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel      
reigned Asa over Judah.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's   
name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of 
YHVH, as did David his father.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4> 
12</H4></TD><TD><P>And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed  
all the idols that his fathers had made.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And also Maachah his mother, even her he        
removed from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa      
destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>But the high places were not      
removed: nevertheless Asa's heart was perfect with YHVH all his days.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And he brought in    
the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had     
dedicated, into the house of YHVH, silver, and gold, and vessels.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And there was war between 
Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And Baasha king of Israel went up against    
Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to    
Asa king of Judah.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the          
treasures of the house of YHVH, and the treasures of the king's house, and      
delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them to         
Benhadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at  
Damascus, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>There is a league between me and thee, and between my father and thy     
father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; come and    
break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>So Benhadad     
hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of the hosts which he had        
against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and 
all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, when Baasha heard       
thereof, that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Then king Asa made a      
proclamation throughout all Judah; none was exempted: and they took away the    
stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king 
Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>The rest of all the acts of Asa,  
and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they 
not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless   
in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And Asa slept with his fathers,   
and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and            
Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign    
over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel    
two years.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And he did evil in the sight of YHVH, and walked in the way of his father, and  
in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of   
Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which       
belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to             
Gibbethon.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in 
his stead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of Jeroboam;  
he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him,          
according unto the saying of YHVH, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the     
Shilonite:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin,  
by his provocation wherewith he provoked YHVH ELOHIYM of Israel to anger.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>Now the rest of 
the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the 
chronicles of the kings of Israel?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32> 
<H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel  
all their days.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD>
<P>In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to     
reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>And he did evil in the sight of   
YHVH, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made       
Israel to sin.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John
