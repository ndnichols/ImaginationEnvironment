<TD><P>Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty      
thousand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of      
Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of ELOHIYM, whose name is called by the  
name of YHVH of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubim.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And they set the ark of ELOHIYM     
upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in        
Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And they brought it    
out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of       
ELOHIYM: and Ahio went before the ark.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And David and all the house of Israel played      
before YHVH on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and   
on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they came to       
Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of ELOHIYM, and    
took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And the anger of YHVH was kindled against Uzzah;  
and ELOHIYM smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of      
ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
David was displeased, because YHVH had made a breach upon Uzzah: and he called  
the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And David was afraid of YHVH that day, and     
said, How shall the ark of YHVH come to me?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>So David would not remove the ark of YHVH unto  
him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of        
Obededom the Gittite.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And the ark of YHVH continued in the house of Obededom the Gittite  
three months: and YHVH blessed Obededom, and all his household.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And it was told king      
David, saying, YHVH hath blessed the house of Obededom, and all that pertaineth 
unto him, because of the ark of ELOHIYM. So David went and brought up the ark   
of ELOHIYM from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And it was so,  
that when they that bare the ark of YHVH had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen 
and fatlings.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And David danced before YHVH with all his might; and David was girded with a 
linen ephod.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>
So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of YHVH with shouting,  
and with the sound of the trumpet.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16> 
<H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And as the ark of YHVH came into the city of David,      
Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and  
dancing before YHVH; and she despised him in her heart.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And they brought in the ark of    
YHVH, and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had    
pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before    
YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And as 
soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings,  
he blessed the people in the name of YHVH of hosts.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And he dealt among all the        
people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men,  
to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine.  
So all the people departed every one to his house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Then David returned to bless his  
household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said,    
How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the 
eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly   
uncovereth himself!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And David said unto Michal, It was before YHVH, which chose me before    
thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of    
YHVH, over Israel: therefore will I play before YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will yet be more vile than  
thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou    
hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honor.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore Michal the daughter of  
Saul had no child unto the day of her death.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This
