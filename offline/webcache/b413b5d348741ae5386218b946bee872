And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple,  
and the Sadducees, came upon them,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2>  
<H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached   
through YAHSHUA the resurrection from the dead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And they laid hands on them, and put them in   
hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Howbeit many of them which heard    
the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass on 
the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And Annas the high priest, and      
Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the    
high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they had set them in the   
midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Peter, filled     
with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of     
Israel,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>If we  
this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means   
he is made whole;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the   
name of YAHSHUA MASHIYACH of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom ELOHIYM raised   
from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>This is the stone    
which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the        
corner.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>     
Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under     
heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Now when they saw the boldness of 
Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they   
marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with YAHSHUA.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And beholding   
the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against     
it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>But when 
they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among    
themselves,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath   
been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we       
cannot deny it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD>
<P>But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten     
them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And they called them, and         
commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of YAHSHUA.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>But Peter and John   
answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of ELOHIYM to     
hearken unto you more than unto ELOHIYM, judge ye.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>For we cannot but speak the       
things which we have seen and heard.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>So when they had further threatened them, they  
let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: 
for all men glorified ELOHIYM for that which was done.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>For the man was above forty years 
old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And being let go, they went to    
their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said  
unto them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to ELOHIYM with one        
accord, and said, YHVH, thou art EL, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the 
sea, and all that in them is:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>  
25</H4></TD><TD><P>Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the 
heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>The kings of the earth stood up,  
and the rulers were gathered together against YHVH, and against his             
MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>  
For of a truth against thy holy child YAHSHUA, whom thou hast anointed, both    
Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were    
gathered together,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be    
done.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
now, YHVH, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with    
all boldness they may speak thy word,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and     
that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child YAHSHUA.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they   
had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they   
were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of ELOHIYM with    
boldness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul:      
neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his    
own; but they had all things common.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And with great power gave the apostles witness  
of the resurrection of the ADONAY YAHSHUA: and great grace was upon them        
all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>Neither 
was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands   
or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And laid them   
down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according  
as he had need.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being       
interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of           
Cyprus,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>     
Having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles'       
feet.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M. Hurt,
