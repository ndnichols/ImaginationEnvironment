<p>1. YEA, this is good to taste and full of. sweetness, verily it is strong and rich in flavour.<br> No one may conquer Indra in the battle when he hath drunken of the draught we offer.<br> 2 This sweet juice here had mightiest power to gladden: it boldened Indra when he siaughtered V&#7771;tra,<br> When he defeated &#346;ambara's many onslaughts, and battered down his nineand ninety ramparts.<br> 3 This stirreth up my voice when I have drunk it: this hath aroused from sleep my yearning spirit.<br> This Sage hath measured out the six expanses from which no single creature is excluded.<br> 4 This, even this, is he who hath created the breadth of earth, the lofty height of heaven.<br> He formed the nectar in three headlong rivers. Soma supports the wide mid-air above us.<br> 5 He found the wavy sea of brilliant colours in forefront of the Dawns who dwell in brightness.<br> This Mighty One, the Steer begirt by Maruts, hath propped the heavens up with a mighty pillar.<br> 6 Drink Soma boldly from the beaker, Indra, in war for treasures, Hero, V&#7771;tra-slayer!<br> Fill thyself full at the mid-day libation, and give us wealth, thou Treasury of riches.<br> 7 Look out for us, O Indra, as our Leader, and guide us on to gain yet goodlier treasure.<br> Excellent Guardian, bear us well through peril, and lead us on to wealth with careful guidance.<br> 8 Lead us to ample room, O thou who knowest, to happiness, security, and sunlight.<br> High, Indra, are the arms of thee the Mighty: may we betake. us to their lofty shelter.<br> 9 Set us on widest chariot-seat, O Indra, with two steeds best to draw, O Lord of Hundreds!<br> Bring us the best among all sorts of viands: let not the foe's wealth, Maghavan, subdue us.<br> 10 Be gracious, Indra, let my days be lengthened: sharpen my thought as &#146;twere a blade of iron<br> Approve whatever words I speak, dependent on thee, and grant me thy divine protection.<br> 11 Indra the Rescuer, Indra the Helper, Hero who listens at each invocation,<br> &#346;akra I call, Indra invoked of many. May Indra Maghavan prosper and bless us.<br> 12 May helpful Indra as our good Protector, Lord of all treasures, favour us with succour,<br> Baffle our foes, and give us rest and safety, and may we be the lords of hero vigour.<br> 13 May we enjoy the grace of him the Holy, yea, may we dwell in his auspicious favour.<br> May helpful Indra as our good Preserver drive from us, even from afar, our foemen.<br> 14 Like rivers rushing down a slope, O Indra, to thee haste songs and prayers and linked verses.<br> Thou gatherest, Thunderer! like widespread bounty, kine, water, drops, and manifold libations.<br> 15 Who lauds him, satisfies him, pays him worship? E&#146;en the rich noble still hath found him mighty.<br> With power, as when one moves his feet alternate, he makes the last precede, the foremost follow.<br> 16 Famed is the Hero as each strong man's tamer, ever advancing one and then another.<br> King of both worlds, hating the high and haughty, Indra protects the men who are his people.<br> 17 He loves no more the men he loved aforetime: he turns and moves away allied with others.<br> Rejecting those who disregard his worship, Indra victorious lives through many autumns.<br> 18 In every figure he hath been the mode: this is his only form for us to look on.<br> Indra moves multiform by his illusions; for his Bay Steeds are yoked, ten times a hundred.<br> 19 Here Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar, yoking to the car the Bay Steeds, hath extended sway.<br> Who will for ever stand upon the foeman's side, even when our princes sit at ease?<br> 20 Gods, we have reached a country void of pasture the land, though spacious, was too small to hold us.<br> B&#7771;haspati, provide in war for cattle; find a path, Indra, for this faithful singer.<br> 21 Day after day far from their seat he drove them, alike, from place to place, those darksome creatures.<br> The Hero slew the meanly-huckstering D&#257;sas, Varcin and &#346;ambara, where the waters gather.<br> 22 Out of thy bounty, Indra, hath Prastoka bestowed ten coffers and ten mettled horses.<br> We have received in turn from Divod&#257;sa &#346;ambara's wealth, the gift of Atithigva.<br> 23 Ten horses and ten treasure-chests, ten garments as an added gift,<br> These and ten lumps of gold have I received from Divod&#257;sa's hand.<br> 24 Ten cars with extra steed to each, for the Atharvans hundred cows,<br> Hath Asvatha to Payu given.<br> 25 Thus S&#7771;&ntilde;jaya's son honoured the Bharadv&#257;jas, recipients of all noble gifts and bounty.<br> 26 Lord of the wood, be firm and strong in body: be, bearing us, a brave victorious hero<br> Show forth thy strength, compact with straps of leather, and let thy rider win all spoils of battle.<br> 27 Its mighty strength was borrowed from the heaven and earth: its conquering force was brought from sovrans of the wood.<br> Honour with holy gifts the Car like Indra's bolt, the Car bound round with straps, the vigour of the floods.<br> 28 Thou Bolt of Indra, Vanguard of the Maruts, close knit to Varu&#7751;a and Child of Mitra,&#151;<br> As such, accepting gifts which here we offer, receive, O Godlike Chariot, these oblations.<br> 29 Send forth thy voice aloud through earth and heaven, and let the world in all its breadth regard thee;<br> O Drum, accordant with the Gods and Indra, drive thou afar, yea, very far, our foemen.<br> 30 Thunder out strength and fill us full of vigour: yea, thunder forth and drive away all dangers.<br> Drive hence, O War-drum, drive away misfortune: thou art the Fist of Indra: show thy firmness.<br> 31 Drive hither those, and these again bring hither: the War-drum speaks aloud as battle's signal.<br> Our heroes, winged with horses, come together. Let our car-warriors, Indra, be triumphant.</p>
