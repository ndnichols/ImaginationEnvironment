<p>1. REPOSING on the river's wave the Sage hath widely flowed around,<br> Bearing the hymn which many love.<br> 2 When the Five kindred Companies, active in duty, with the song<br> Establish him, the Powerful,<br> 3 Then in his juice whose strength is great, have all the Gods rejoiced themselves,<br> When he hath clothed him in the milk.<br> 4 Freeing himself he flows away, leaving his body's severed limbs,<br> And meets his own Companion here.<br> 5 He by the daughters of the priest, like a fair youth, hath been adorned,<br> Making the milk, as &#146;twere, his robe.<br> 6 O'er the fine fingers, through desire of milk, in winding course he goes,<br> And utters voice which he hath found.<br> 7 The nimble fingers have approached, adorning him the Lord of Strength:<br> They grasp the vigorous Courser's back.<br> 8 Comprising all the treasures that are in the heavens and on the earth,<br> Come, Soma, as our faithful Friend.</p>
