the anger of YHVH was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the      
Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh  
forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.</P>

Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in       
peace.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
YHVH said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead

hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
YHVH said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do    
all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I will    
harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

him, and sought to kill him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>   
25</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin   
of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou 
to me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>So he 
let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, because of the            
circumcision.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And YHVH said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went,

him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And     
Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of

Aaron spake all the words which YHVH had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs   
in the sight of the people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>    
31</H4></TD><TD><P>And the people believed: and when they heard that YHVH had

then they bowed their heads and worshipped.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This
