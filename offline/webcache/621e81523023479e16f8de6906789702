<TD><P>And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which 
had a withered hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that 
they might accuse him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand        
forth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And he  
saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to 
save life, or to kill? But they held their peace.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he had looked round about  
on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith    
unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand   
was restored whole as the other.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>
6</H4></TD><TD><P>And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel    
with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>But YAHSHUA withdrew himself    
with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, 
and from Judaea,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about 
Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he     
did, came unto him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him      
because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>For he had healed many; insomuch  
that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And unclean spirits, 
when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of 
ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And he goeth up into a        
mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would: and they came unto him.</P></TD>

twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to      
preach,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And James the   
son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges,  
which is, The sons of thunder:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4> 
18</H4></TD><TD><P>And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and

</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And the         
multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat          
bread.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said,  
He is beside himself.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath        
Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And he called them unto   
him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And if a kingdom be       
divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>      
Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and     
blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>But he that shall blaspheme

damnation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>

thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And he
