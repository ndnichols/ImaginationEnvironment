could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto    
babes in MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not    
able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is    
among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as    
men?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>For while 
one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Who then is Paul,

every man?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>I   
have planted, Apollos watered; but ELOHIYM gave the increase.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>So then neither is he that

increase.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Now  
he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his

buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.</P>

<H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with
