<TD><P>But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And he prayed unto YHVH,    
and said, I pray thee, O YHVH, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my     
country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a      
gracious EL, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest  
thee of the evil.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD>
<P>Therefore now, O YHVH, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is      
better for me to die than to live.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4>

city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat 
under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.</P>

prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow  
over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of    
the gourd.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>But 
ELOHIYM prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the    
gourd that it withered.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that ELOHIYM prepared  
a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, 
and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to      
live.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And      
ELOHIYM said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said,  
I do well to be angry, even unto death.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

up in a night, and perished in a night:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

city, wherein are more then sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern       
between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?</P></TD>
