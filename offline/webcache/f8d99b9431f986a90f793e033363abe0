1</H4></TD><TD><P>Again the word of YHVH came unto me, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Son of man, cause Jerusalem to  
know her abominations,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And say, Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH unto Jerusalem; Thy birth and   
thy nativity is of the land of Canaan; thy father was an Amorite, and thy       
mother an Hittite.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not     
cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee; thou wast not salted at  
all, nor swaddled at all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have         
compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the lothing  
of thy person, in the day that thou wast born.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And when I passed by thee, and saw thee        
polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood,      
Live; yea, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>I have caused thee to multiply  
as the bud of the field, and thou hast increased and waxen great, and thou art  
come to excellent ornaments: thy breasts are fashioned, and thine hair is       
grown, whereas thou wast naked and bare.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee,  
behold, thy time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and     
covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with 
thee, saith the ADONAY YHVH, and thou becamest mine.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Then washed I thee with water; yea, 
I throughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>I clothed thee  
also with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers' skin, and I girded thee   
about with fine linen, and I covered thee with silk.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>I decked thee also with           
ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And I put a jewel on 
thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thine      
head.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus   
wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was of fine linen, and   
silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and    
thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper into a kingdom.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And thy renown went  
forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it was perfect through my           
comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the ADONAY YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>But thou didst trust in thine 
own beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy 
fornications on every one that passed by; his it was.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And of thy garments thou didst    
take, and deckedst thy high places with divers colours, and playedst the harlot 
thereupon: the like things shall not come, neither shall it be so.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou hast also taken thy  
fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest to  
thyself images of men, and didst commit whoredom with them,</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And tookest thy broidered     
garments, and coveredst them: and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense       
before them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>
My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed 
thee, thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savour: and thus it was,    
saith the ADONAY YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast 
borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. Is this 
of thy whoredoms a small matter,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21>   
<H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to  
cause them to pass through the fire for them?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And in all thine abominations and thy        
whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked  
and bare, and wast polluted in thy blood.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass after all thy wickedness,   
(woe, woe unto thee! saith the ADONAY YHVH;)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>That thou hast also built unto thee an eminent  
place, and hast made thee an high place in every street.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou hast built thy high place at 
every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened 
thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou hast also       
committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, great of flesh; and    
hast increased thy whoredoms, to provoke me to anger.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>Behold, therefore I have          
stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thine ordinary food, and   
delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the       
Philistines, which are ashamed of thy lewd way.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou hast played the whore also with the     
Assyrians, because thou wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with  
them, and yet couldest not be satisfied.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication   
in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied             
therewith.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>  
How weak is thine heart, saith the ADONAY YHVH, seeing thou doest all these     
things, the work of an imperious whorish woman;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>In that thou buildest thine eminent place in 
the head of every way, and makest thine high place in every street; and hast    
not been as an harlot, in that thou scornest hire;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>But as a wife that committeth     
adultery, which taketh strangers instead of her husband!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>They give gifts to all whores:    
but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may     
come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>And the contrary is in thee from other women 
in thy whoredoms, whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that  
thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee, therefore thou art      
contrary.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of YHVH:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH; Because thy         
filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms   
with thy lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood   
of thy children, which thou didst give unto them;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>Behold, therefore I will gather   
all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast 
loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about  
against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all  
thy nakedness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are        
judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will also give thee into    
their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down 
thy high places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy  
fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>They shall also bring up a company against      
thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their 
swords.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the  
sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot,    
and thou also shalt give no hire any more.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and 
my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more    
angry.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>      
Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fretted me in  
all these things; behold, therefore I also will recompense thy way upon thine   
head, saith the ADONAY YHVH: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all  
thine abominations.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against     
thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou art thy mother's daughter,   
that lotheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy       
sisters, which lothed their husbands and their children: your mother was an     
Hittite, and your father an Amorite.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at 
thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V47><H4>47</H4></TD><TD><P>Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor  
done after their abominations: but, as if that were a very little thing, thou   
wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V48><H4>48</H4></TD><TD><P>As I live, saith the ADONAY YHVH, Sodom thy

daughters.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V49><H4>49</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and 
abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she          
strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V51><H4>51</H4></TD><TD><P>Neither hath Samaria      
committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more

Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame for thy sins     
that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous

justified thy sisters.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V53><H4>53</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom

bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them:</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V54><H4>54</H4></TD><TD><P>That thou mayest bear

Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith YHVH.</P></TD></TR>
