Chapter 12</H1></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man planted a     
vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for the winefat, and    
built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And at the season 
he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen  
of the fruit of the vineyard.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>   
3</H4></TD><TD><P>And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away          
empty.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And     
again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and       
wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And again he sent another; and  
him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Having yet therefore one    
son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will        
reverence my son.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD>
<P>But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us   
kill him, and the inheritance shall be our's.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And they took him, and killed him, and cast    
him out of the vineyard.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and  
destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And have ye not read this 
scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the      
corner:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>This 
was YHVH's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And they sought to lay hold on    
him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable        
against them: and they left him, and went their way.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And they send unto him certain of 
the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they were come, they 
say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for    
thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of ELOHIYM in truth: 
Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, 
knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny,     
that I may see it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and     
superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA answering said unto   
them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to ELOHIYM the things  
that are EL's. And they marvelled at him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say     
there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a 
man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that   
his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Now there were seven 
brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And the second took her, and  
died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And the seven had her, and left   
no seed: last of all the woman died also.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>In the resurrection therefore, when they shall  
rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA          
answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the      
scriptures, neither the power of ELOHIYM?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>For when they shall rise from the dead, they    
neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in    
heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses,    
how in the bush ELOHIYM spake unto him, saying, I am the ELOHIYM of Abraham,    
and the ELOHIYM of Isaac, and the ELOHIYM of Jacob?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>He is not the ELOHIYM of the      
dead, but the ELOHIYM of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And one of the scribes    
came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had      
answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA answered 
him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; YHVH our ELOHIYM is  
one YHVH :</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And thou shalt love YHVH thy ELOHIYM with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, 
and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first             
commandment.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>
And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.  
There is none other commandment greater than these.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And the scribe said unto him,     
Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one ELOHIYM; and there is  
none other but he:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and  
with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as      
himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>And when YAHSHUA saw that 
he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of  
EL. And no man after that durst ask him any question.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA answered and said,    
while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that MASHIYACH is the son of 
David?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>For   
David himself said by the Holy Ghost, YHVH said to my ADOWN, Sit thou on my     
right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>David therefore himself calleth   
him ADOWN; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him       
gladly.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in   
long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>And the chief seats in the        
synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>Which devour widows' houses, and for a       
pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA sat over      
against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury:   
and many that were rich cast in much.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>And there came a certain poor widow, and she    
threw in two mites, which make a farthing.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>And he called unto him his disciples, and saith 
unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than  
all they which have cast into the treasury:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>For all they did cast in of their abundance;    
but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.</P></TD>
