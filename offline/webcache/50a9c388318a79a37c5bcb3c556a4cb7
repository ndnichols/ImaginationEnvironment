</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>Let a man so      
account of us, as of the ministers of MASHIYACH, and stewards of the mysteries  
of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>But with me it is a very    
small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge  
not mine own self.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that 
judgeth me is YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the ADONAY come, who both 
will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the   
counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of ELOHIYM.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And these things, 
brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your      
sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is        
written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>For who maketh thee to      
differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if     
thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received       
it?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Now ye are 
full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would ye did  
reign, that we also might reign with you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>For I think that ELOHIYM hath set forth us the    
apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto  
the world, and to angels, and to men.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>We are fools for MASHIYACH's sake, but ye are   
wise in MASHIYACH; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we    
are despised.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and   
are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Being defamed, we         
intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all  
things unto this day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I     
warn you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>   
For though ye have ten thousand instructers in MASHIYACH, yet have ye not many  
fathers: for in MASHIYACH YAHSHUA I have begotten you through the gospel.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore I     
beseech you, be ye followers of me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17>
<H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my 
beloved son, and faithful in the ADONAY, who shall bring you into remembrance   
of my ways which be in MASHIYACH, as I teach every where in every church.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Now some are    
puffed up, as though I would not come to you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>But I will come to you shortly, if YHVH      
will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the        
power.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>For   
the kingdom of EL is not in word, but in power.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>

rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This
