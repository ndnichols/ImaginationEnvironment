upon Azariah the son of Oded:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>

Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; YHVH is with you, while ye be with him; and if 
ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake    
you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Now for a 
long season Israel hath been without the true ELOHIYM, and without a teaching   
priest, and without law.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>But when they in their trouble did turn unto YHVH ELOHIYM of        
Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And in those times there was no peace to him   
that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the   
inhabitants of the countries.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>   
6</H4></TD><TD><P>And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for     
ELOHIYM did vex them with all adversity.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy  
of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of  
all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken    
from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of YHVH, that was before the porch of 
YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And he   
gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and 
Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance,   
when they saw that YHVH his ELOHIYM was with him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>So they gathered themselves       
together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of 
Asa.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And     
they offered unto YHVH the same time, of the spoil which they had brought,      
seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

ELOHIYM of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>That whosoever would 
not seek YHVH ELOHIYM of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, 
whether man or woman.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4>

with trumpets, and with cornets.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15>   
<H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn   
with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found  
of them: and YHVH gave them rest round about.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And also concerning Maachah the mother of    
Asa the king, he removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in  
a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook   
Kidron.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>But  
the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of    
Asa was perfect all his days.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>

vessels.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.</P>
