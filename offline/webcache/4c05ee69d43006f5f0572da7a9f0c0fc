Now after the death of Moses the servant of YHVH it came to pass, that YHVH     
spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Moses my servant is dead; now       
therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land  
which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Every place that the sole of your   
foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>From the          
wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all 
the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the   
sun, shall be your coast.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days   
of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, 
nor forsake thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD>
<P>Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for  
an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Only be thou strong

the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>This book of the law shall not  
depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that    
thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then    
thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Have not I        
commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou

</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Joshua          
commanded the officers of the people, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>

people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over  
this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which YHVH your ELOHIYM giveth you   
to possess it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of          
Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>

you, saying, YHVH your ELOHIYM hath given you rest, and hath given you this     
land.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Your   
wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses  
gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all 
the mighty men of valor, and help them;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which YHVH your ELOHIYM   
giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy   
it, which Moses YHVH's servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the          
sunrising.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and   
whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

things, so will we hearken unto thee: only YHVH thy ELOHIYM be with thee, as he 
was with Moses.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD>
<P>Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not        
hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to      
death: only be strong and of a good courage.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This
