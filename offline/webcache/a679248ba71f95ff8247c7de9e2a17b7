Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of ELOHIYM but the Levites: for

<A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And David assembled the children of Aaron, and

Amminadab,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify    
yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of YHVH     
ELOHIYM of Israel unto the place that I have prepared for it.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>For because ye did it not at

after the due order.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up    
the ark of YHVH ELOHIYM of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15> 
<H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And the children of the Levites bare the ark of ELOHIYM  
upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to   
the word of YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren to 
be the singers with instruments of music, psalteries and harps and cymbals,     
sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; 
and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari      
their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And with them their brethren of the second

Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah,  
and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

appointed to sound with cymbals of brass;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and  
Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on      
Alamoth;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah,  
with harps on the Sheminith to excel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for    
song: he instructed about the song, because he was skillful.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And Berechiah and Elkanah     
were doorkeepers for the ark.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>  
24</H4></TD><TD><P>And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai,   
and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the         
trumpets before the ark of ELOHIYM: and Obededom and Jehiah were doorkeepers    
for the ark.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>
So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to    
bring up the ark of the covenant of YHVH out of the house of Obededom with      
joy.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And it  
came to pass, when ELOHIYM helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant 
of YHVH, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And David was clothed with a robe 
of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and      
Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also had upon him an   
ephod of linen.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD>
<P>Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of YHVH with shouting,    
and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a     
noise with psalteries and harps.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29>   
<H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of YHVH  
came to the city of David, that Michal, the daughter of Saul looking out at a   
window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her          
heart.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M.
