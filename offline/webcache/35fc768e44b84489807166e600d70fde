and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward:  
for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down  
from under from the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Then brought he   
me out of the way of the gate northward, and led me about the way without unto  
the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward; and, behold, there ran out     
waters on the right side.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4>

he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters 
were to the ankles.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; the     
waters were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through; 
the waters were to the loins.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>

could not be passed over.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this? Then he       
brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Now when I had returned,

down into the desert, and go into the sea: which being brought forth into the   
sea, the waters shall be healed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>

which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live: and there shall  
be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall come thither: for 
they shall be healed; and every thing shall live whither the river cometh.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And it shall

the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all  
trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be   
consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their

meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A
