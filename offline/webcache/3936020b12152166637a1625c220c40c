1</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, when YAHSHUA had made an end of          
commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in   
their cities.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Now when John had heard in the prison the works of MASHIYACH, he sent two of    
his disciples,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>
And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA answered  
and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and    
see:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>The blind 
receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf   
hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And blessed is    
he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And as they departed, YAHSHUA began to say unto   
the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A  
reed shaken with the wind?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4>
</TD><TD><P>But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment?     
behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>But what went ye out for to see? A  
prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>For this is he, of whom it is     
written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy   
way before thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not  
risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the  
kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And from the days of John the Baptist until now 
the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>For all the     
prophets and the law prophesied until John.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which 
was for to come.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>But whereunto shall I liken this generation? 
It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their         
fellows,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto    
you, and ye have not lamented.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4> 
18</H4></TD><TD><P>For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He  
hath a devil.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man          
gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is  
justified of her children.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>     
20</H4></TD><TD><P>Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his      
mighty works were done, because they repented not:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto 
thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done 
in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>But I say unto  
you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than 
for you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell:  
for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom,  
it would have remained until this day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>But I say unto you, That it shall be more       
tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>At that time YAHSHUA 
answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, ELOHIYM of heaven and earth, because 
thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them    
unto babes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>All things are delivered unto me  
of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any   
man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Come unto me,   
all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</P></TD></TR>

and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto  
your souls.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P> 
For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This
