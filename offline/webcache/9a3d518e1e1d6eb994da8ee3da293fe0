<p>1. WHERE is famed Indra heard of? With what folk is he renowned to-day as Mitra is,&#151;<br> Who in the home of &#7770;&#7779;is and in secret is extolled with song?<br> 2 Even here is Indra famed, and among us this day the glorious Thunderer is praised,<br> He who like Mitra mid the folk hath won complete and full renown.<br> 3 He who is Sovran Lord of great and perfect strength, exerter of heroic might,<br> Who bears the fearless thunder as a father bears his darling son.<br> 4 Harnessing to thy car, as God, two blustering Steeds Of the Wind-God, O Thunderer,<br> That speed along the shining path, thou making ways art glorified.<br> 5 Even to these dark Steeds of Wind thou of thyself hast come to ride,<br> Of which no driver may be found, none, be he God or mortal man.<br> 6 When ye approach, men ask you, thee and U&#347;an&#257;: Why come ye to our dwelling-place?<br> Why are ye come to mortal man from distant realms of eapth and heaven?<br> 7 O Indra, thou shalt speak us fair: our holy prayer is offered up.<br> We pray to thee for help as thou didst strike the monster &#346;u&#7779;&#7751;a dead.<br> 8 Around us is the Dasyu, riteless, void of sense, inhuman, keeping alien laws.<br> Baffle, thou Slayer of the foe, the weapon which this D&#257;sa wields.<br> 9 Hero with Heroes, thou art ours: yea, strong are they whom thou dost help.<br> In many a place are thy full gifts, and men, like vassals, sing thy praise.<br> 10 Urge thou these heroes on to slay the enemy, brave Thunderer! in the fight with swords.<br> Even when hid among the tribes of Sages numerous as stars.<br> 11 Swift come those gifts of thine whose hand is prompt to rend and burn, O Hero Thunder-armed:<br> As thou with thy Companions didst destroy the whole of SuSnia's brood.<br> 12 Let not thine excellent assistance come to us, O Hero Indra, profitless.<br> May we, may we enjoy the bliss of these thy favours, Thunderer!<br> 13 May those soft impulses of thine, O Indra, be fruitful and innocent to us.<br> May we know these whose treasures are like those of milch-kine, Thunderer!<br> 14 That Earth, through power of knowing things that may be known, handless and footless yet might thrive,<br> Thou slewest, turning to the right, gu;na for every living man.<br> 15 Drink, drink the Soma, Hero Indra; be not withheld as thou art good, O Treasure-giver.<br> Preserve the singers and our liberal princes, and make us wealthy with abundant riches.</p>
