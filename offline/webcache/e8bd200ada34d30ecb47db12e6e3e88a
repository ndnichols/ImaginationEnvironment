<TD><P>And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges   
over Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: they 
were judges in Beersheba.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre,  
and took bribes, and perverted judgment.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves 
together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy  
sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the          
nations.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>But   
the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And    
Samuel prayed unto YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And YHVH said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in  
all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have     
rejected me, that I should not reign over them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>According to all the works which they have     
done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day,      
wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto    
thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Now      
therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and 
show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And Samuel told all the words 
of YHVH unto the people that asked of him a king.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, This will be the     
manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and       
appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some    
shall run before his chariots.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4> 
12</H4></TD><TD><P>And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and         
captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his     
harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his             
chariots.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to  
be bakers.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the 
best of them, and give them to his servants.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of 
your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And he will take your         
menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your      
asses, and put them to his work.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17>   
<H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be    
his servants.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have    
chosen you; and YHVH will not hear you in that day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Nevertheless the people refused   
to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over   
us;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>That we  
also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out    
before us, and fight our battles.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21>

his city.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M.
