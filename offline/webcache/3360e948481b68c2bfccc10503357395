the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that

<H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed        
iniquity, we have done wickedly.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>

at the Red sea.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his

praise.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>They 
soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

leanness into their soul.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>      
16</H4></TD><TD><P>They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of   
YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>The    
earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the company of Abiram.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And a fire was       
kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

worshipped the molten image.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>

</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Wondrous works  
in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore he said that he would   
destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn  
away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

believed not his word:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of    
YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>       
Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the          
wilderness:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P> 
To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the      
lands.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>They  
joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus they       
provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon       
them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>Then   
stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And that was counted 
unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>They angered him also at the  
waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>Because they provoked his 
spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>They did not destroy the nations, 
concerning whom YHVH commanded them:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>But were mingled among the heathen, and learned 
their works.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>
And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>Yea, they sacrificed their sons   
and their daughters unto devils,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38>   
<H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons    
and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the  
land was polluted with blood.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>  
39</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a      
whoring with their own inventions.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40> 
<H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore was the wrath of YHVH kindled against his      
people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>And he gave them into the hand of 
the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>Their enemies also oppressed      
them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>Many times did he deliver     
them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their  
iniquity.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P>And he remembered    
for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his           
mercies.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46><H4>46</H4></TD><TD><P>He
