house for the name of YHVH, and an house for his kingdom.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the          
mountain, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And Solomon sent to Huram the

him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein, even so deal with me.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Behold, I build   
an house to the name of YHVH my ELOHIYM, to dedicate it to him, and to burn     
before him sweet incense, and for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt    
offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on    
the solemn feasts of YHVH our ELOHIYM. This is an ordinance for ever to         
Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
the house which I build is great: for great is our ELOHIYM above all gods.</P>

sacrifice before him?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and

to grave with the cunning men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom  
David my father did provide.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>

Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and,  
behold, my servants shall be with thy servants,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for    
the house which I am about to build shall be wonderful great.</P></TD></TR><TR>

prudence and understanding, that might build an house for YHVH, and an house    
for his kingdom.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of Huram   
my father's,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>
The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre,   
skillful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in    
timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave    
any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him,  
with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David thy father.</P>

the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, 
let him send unto his servants:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>

need: and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt    
carry it up to Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>

of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them;    
and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six    
hundred.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens, and

hundred overseers to set the people a work.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This
