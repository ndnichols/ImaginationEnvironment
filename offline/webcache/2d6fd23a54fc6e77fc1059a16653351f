<p>1. GOD-SERVING men, O Sovran of the Forest, with heavenly meath at sacrifice anoint thee.<br> Grant wealth to us when thou art standing upright as when reposing on this Mother's bosom.<br> 2 Set up to eastward of the fire enkindled, accepting prayer that wastes not, rich in hero.<br> Driving far from us poverty and famine, lift thyself up to bring us great good fortune.<br> 3 Lord of the Forest, raise. thyself up on the loftiest spot of earth.<br> Give splendour, fixt and measured well, to him who brings the sacrifice.<br> 4 Well-robed, enveloped he is come, the youthful: springing to life his glory waxeth greater.<br> Contemplative in mind and God-adoring, sages of high intelligence upraise him.<br> 5 Sprung up he rises in the days' fair weather, increasing in the men-frequented synod.<br> With song the wise and skilful consecrate him: his voice the God-adoring singer utters.<br> 6, Ye whom religious men have firmly planted; thou Forest Sovran whom the axe hath fashioned,&#151;<br> Let those the Stakes divine which here are standing be fain to grant us wealth with store of children.<br> 7 O men who lift the ladles up, these hewn and planted in the ground,<br> Bringing a blessing to the field, shall bear our precious gift to Gods.<br> 8 &#256;dityas, Rudras, Vasus, careful leaders, Earth, Heaven, and Prthivi and Air's mid-region,<br> Accordant Deities shall bless our worship and make our sacrifice's ensign lofty.<br> 9 Like swan's that flee in lengthened line, the Pillars have come to us arrayed in brilliant coIour.<br> They, lifted up on high, by sages, eastward, go forth as Gods to the God's dwelling-places.<br> 10 Those Stakes upon the earth with rings that deck them seem to the eye like horns of horned creatures;<br> Or, as upraised by priests in invocation, let them assist us in the rush to battle.<br> 11 Lord of the Wood, rise with a hundred branches. with thousand branches may we rise to greatness,<br> Tlou whom this hatchct, with an edge well whetted for great felicity, hath brought before us.</p>
