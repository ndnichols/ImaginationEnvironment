VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>Now I say, That the heir, as long   
as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of        
all;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>But is

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Even so we, when we were    
children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>But when the fulness of the time    
was come, ELOHIYM sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>To redeem them    
that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And because ye are     
sons, ELOHIYM hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying,   
Abba, Father.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of  
ELOHIYM through MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Howbeit then, when ye knew not ELOHIYM, ye did service unto them    
which by nature are no gods.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>    
9</H4></TD><TD><P>But now, after that ye have known ELOHIYM, or rather are      
known of EL, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye  
desire again to be in bondage?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4> 
10</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>I am afraid of you,  
lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I   
am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I    
preached the gospel unto you at the first.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And my temptation which was in my flesh ye      
despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of ELOHIYM, even as     
MASHIYACH YAHSHUA.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that,  
if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have      
given them to me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>They zealously       
affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect     
them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>But it 
is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am 
present with you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until MASHIYACH be  
formed in you,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in  
doubt of you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>For it is written,   
that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>But he who was  
of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by       
promise.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the 
mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>For this Agar is mount Sinai in   
Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her     
children.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>   
But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>For it is written,   
Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that           
travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an 
husband.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Now 
we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>But as then he that was born      
after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is    
now.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>        
Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for  
the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>So then,        
brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.</P></TD></TR>
