Chapter 7</H1></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of    
Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of       
Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could 
not prevail against it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate    
with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the      
trees of the wood are moved with the wind.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said YHVH unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet  
Ahaz, thou, and Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper     
pool in the highway of the fuller's field;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear   
not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for 
the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Because Syria, Ephraim, and 
the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying,</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Let us go up against Judah, 
and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the      
midst of it, even the son of Tabeal:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7>
<H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH, It shall not stand, neither   
shall it come to pass.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is      
Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be 
not a people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son.  
If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover YHVH spake again     
unto Ahaz, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Ask thee a sign of YHVH thy ELOHIYM; ask it either in the depth, or in   
the height above.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt YHVH.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, Hear ye now, 
O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary   
my ELOHIYM also?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Therefore the ADONAY himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin     
shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Butter and honey shall he 
eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>For before the child shall    
know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest      
shall be forsaken of both her kings.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>YHVH shall bring upon thee, and upon thy        
people, and upon thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day that 
Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And it shall come to pass in that 
day, that YHVH shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the      
rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And they shall come, and  
shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks,  
and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>In the same day shall the ADONAY shave with a   
razor that is hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria,  
the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And it shall    
come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a young cow, and two         
sheep;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall  
eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the        
land.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And it 
shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall be, where there were a   
thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, it shall even be for briers and       
thorns.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>With 
arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all the land shall become  
briers and thorns.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there shall not  
come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it shall be for the sending     
forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
