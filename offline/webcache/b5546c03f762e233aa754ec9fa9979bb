1</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, when YAHSHUA had finished all these      
sayings, he said unto his disciples,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2>
<H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, 
and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Then assembled together the chief priests, and 
the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest,  
who was called Caiaphas,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And consulted that they might take YAHSHUA by subtilty, and kill    
him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>But they  
said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Now when YAHSHUA was   
in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>There came unto him a woman having an alabaster   
box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>But when his      
disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this         
waste?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>For     
this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>When YAHSHUA         
understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath        
wrought a good work upon me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>   
11</H4></TD><TD><P>For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not     
always.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>For  
in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Verily I say    
unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there   
shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Then one of the 
twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And said unto them, What will 
ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for   
thirty pieces of silver.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Now the first day of 
the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to YAHSHUA, saying unto him,   
Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, Go into the city 
to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will   
keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And the disciples did as YAHSHUA  
had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Now when the even was come, he    
sat down with the twelve.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>      
21</H4></TD><TD><P>And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that    
one of you shall betray me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>    
22</H4></TD><TD><P>And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of    
them to say unto him, ADONAY, is it I?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And he answered and said, He that dippeth his   
hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>The Son of man goeth as it is     
written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it    
had been good for that man if he had not been born.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Judas, which betrayed him,   
answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And as they were     
eating, YAHSHUA took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the    
disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And he took the cup, and gave     
thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>For this is my blood of the new   
testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>But I say unto you, I will    
not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it  
new with you in my Father's kingdom.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they had sung an hymn, they went out   
into the mount of Olives.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>      
31</H4></TD><TD><P>Then saith YAHSHUA unto them, All ye shall be offended       
because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the 
sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>But after I am risen again, I will go before 
you into Galilee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended       
because of thee, yet will I never be offended.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA said unto him, Verily I say unto     
thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>Peter said unto him, 
Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all 
the disciples.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>Then cometh YAHSHUA with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto 
the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And he took with him Peter and    
the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>Then saith he unto them,  
My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with  
me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>And he   
went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father,   
if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but   
as thou wilt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto    
Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>Watch and pray, that ye enter not 
into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>He went away again   
the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away 
from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>And he came and found them asleep again: for 
their eyes were heavy.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time,   
saying the same words.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45><H4>45</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, 
and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed 
into the hands of sinners.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46><H4>     
46</H4></TD><TD><P>Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth       
betray me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>47</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a      
great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of    
the people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V48><H4>48</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss,     
that same is he: hold him fast.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V49><H4>
49</H4></TD><TD><P>And forthwith he came to YAHSHUA, and said, Hail, master;    
and kissed him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V50><H4>50</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And YAHSHUA said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they,  
and laid hands on YAHSHUA and took him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V51><H4>51</H4></TD><TD><P>And, behold, one of them which were with        
YAHSHUA stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the 
high priest's, and smote off his ear.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V52><H4>52</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said YAHSHUA unto him, Put up again thy    
sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the    
sword.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V53><H4>53</H4></TD><TD><P>      
Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give  
me more than twelve legions of angels?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V54><H4>54</H4></TD><TD><P>But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, 
that thus it must be?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V55><H4>55</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>In that same hour said YAHSHUA to the multitudes, Are ye come out   
as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you  
teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V56><H4>56</H4></TD><TD><P>But all this was done, that the   
scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook   
him, and fled.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V57><H4>57</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And they that had laid hold on YAHSHUA led him away to Caiaphas the high     
priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V58><H4>58</H4></TD><TD><P>But Peter followed him afar off   
unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see   
the end.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V59><H4>59</H4></TD><TD><P>Now 
the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness        
against YAHSHUA, to put him to death;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V60><H4>60</H4></TD><TD><P>But found none: yea, though many false          
witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V61><H4>61</H4></TD><TD><P>And said, This  
fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of EL, and to build it in three    
days.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V62><H4>62</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it    
which these witness against thee?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V63>  
<H4>63</H4></TD><TD><P>But YAHSHUA held his peace, And the high priest answered 
and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living EL, that thou tell us whether    
thou be the MASHIYACH, the Son of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V64><H4>64</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA saith unto him, Thou hast said:         
nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on   
the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V65><H4>65</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the high priest rent his 
clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of         
witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V66><H4>66</H4></TD><TD><P>What think ye? They answered and  
said, He is guilty of death.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V67><H4>   
67</H4></TD><TD><P>Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others 
smote him with the palms of their hands,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V68><H4>68</H4></TD><TD><P>Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou MASHIYACH, Who   
is he that smote thee?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V69><H4>69</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him,    
saying, Thou also wast with YAHSHUA of Galilee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V70><H4>70</H4></TD><TD><P>But he denied before them all, saying, I     
know not what thou sayest.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V71><H4>     
71</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw    
him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with YAHSHUA of   
Nazareth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V72><H4>72</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V73><H4>73</H4></TD><TD><P>And after a while came unto him   
they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for    
thy speech bewrayeth thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V74><H4>     
74</H4></TD><TD><P>Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the  
man. And immediately the cock crew.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V75>
<H4>75</H4></TD><TD><P>And Peter remembered the word of YAHSHUA, which said     
unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and 
wept bitterly.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John
