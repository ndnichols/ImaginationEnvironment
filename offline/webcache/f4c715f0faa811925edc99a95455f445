<TD><P>Thus hath the ADONAY YHVH shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed         
grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, 
it was the latter growth after the king's mowings.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O ADONAY YHVH,    
forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>YHVH repented for      
this: It shall not be, saith YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4>  
<H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus hath the ADONAY YHVH shewed unto me: and, behold,    
the ADONAY YHVH called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and  
did eat up a part.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD>

</TD><TD><P>YHVH repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the ADONAY    
YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus he  
shewed me: and, behold, the ADONAY stood upon a wall made by a plumbline, with  
a plumbline in his hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And YHVH said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A         
plumbline. Then said the ADONAY, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of 
my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And the high places of Isaac shall  
be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise 
against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to    
Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst  
of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>For thus Amos saith, 
Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive    
out of their own land.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into   
the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>But prophesy not again any    
more at Bethel: for it is the king's chapel, and it is the king's court.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Then answered   
Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but 
I was an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH took me as I followed    
the flock, and YHVH said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Now therefore hear   
thou the word of YHVH: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not   
thy word against the house of Isaac.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and 
thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and   
Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
