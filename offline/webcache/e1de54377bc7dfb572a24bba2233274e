<TD><P>And YHVH said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I   
have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go,  
I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among 
his sons.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And YHVH said,     
Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to YHVH.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And call Jesse to the       
sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto  
me him whom I name unto thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>   
4</H4></TD><TD><P>And Samuel did that which YHVH spake, and came to Bethlehem.  
And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou        
peaceably?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto YHVH: sanctify yourselves, and  
come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called 
them to the sacrifice.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab,  
and said, Surely YHVH's anointed is before him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>But YHVH said unto Samuel, Look not on his     
countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for   
YHVH seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but     
YHVH looketh on the heart.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he 
said, Neither hath YHVH chosen this.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9>
<H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither  
hath YHVH chosen this.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And      
Samuel said unto Jesse, YHVH hath not chosen these.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are   
here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and,      
behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him:   
for we will not sit down till he come hither.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was  
ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And YHVH   
said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed  
him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of YHVH came upon David from   
that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>But the Spirit of YHVH departed   
from Saul, and an evil spirit from YHVH troubled him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And Saul's servants said unto     
him, Behold now, an evil spirit from ELOHIYM troubleth thee.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Let our lord now command thy  
servants, which are before thee, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on  
an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from ELOHIYM is upon   
thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And Saul said unto his    
servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Then answered one of 
the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite,    
that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and     
prudent in matters, and a comely person, and YHVH is with him.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore Saul sent           
messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which is with the       
sheep.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent   
them by David his son unto Saul.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21>   
<H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he     
loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And Saul sent to Jesse, saying,   
Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favor in my          
sight.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
it came to pass, when the evil spirit from ELOHIYM was upon Saul, that David    
took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well,    
and the evil spirit departed from him.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software
