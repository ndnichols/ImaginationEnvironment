Chapter 26</H1></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide   
himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Saul arose, and went down to   
the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to 
seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which   
is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw   
that Saul came after him into the wilderness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>David therefore sent out spies, and understood 
that Saul was come in very deed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>
5</H4></TD><TD><P>And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had         
pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner,   
the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched     
round about him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the    
son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to    
the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>So David and Abishai came to the    
people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his      
spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round    
about him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Then said Abishai to David, ELOHIYM hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand  
this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to   
the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And David said to Abishai,      
Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against YHVH's anointed,    
and be guiltless?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>David said furthermore, As YHVH liveth, YHVH shall smite him; or his day 
shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>YHVH forbid that I should 
stretch forth mine hand against YHVH's anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou    
now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>So David took   
the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they gat them away,   
and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep;       
because a deep sleep from the ADOWN was fallen upon them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Then David went over to the other 
side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space being between     
them:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou  
not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the       
king?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in     
Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one 
of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>This thing is not good that thou hast done.  
As YHVH liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master,     
YHVH's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water  
that was at his bolster.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son    
David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, Wherefore doth my    
lord thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in    
mine hand?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. 
If YHVH have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if     
they be the children of men, cursed be they before YHVH; for they have driven   
me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of YHVH, saying, Go, serve      
other gods.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of YHVH: for  
the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a          
partridge in the mountains.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>    
21</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I   
will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: 
behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And David answered and said,  
Behold the king's spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch       
it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>YHVH     
render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; for YHVH delivered  
thee into my hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against       
YHVH's anointed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let   
my life be much set by in the eyes of YHVH, and let him deliver me out of all   
tribulation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>
Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do      
great things, and also shalt still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul  
returned to his place.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000
