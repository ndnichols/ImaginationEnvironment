are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith  
YHVH of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call     
them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom YHVH hath          
indignation for ever.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD>

YHVH of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein    
have we despised thy name?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4>

accept thy person? saith YHVH of hosts.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A
