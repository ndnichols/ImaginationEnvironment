<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>If one be found slain in the    
land which YHVH thy ELOHIYM giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and  
it be not known who hath slain him:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2> 
<H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they 
shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain:</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And it shall be, that  
the city which is next unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall   
take an heifer, which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in   
the yoke;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, which  
is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the heifer's neck there in the  
valley:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them YHVH thy ELOHIYM hath    
chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of YHVH; and by their     
word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And all the elders of that city,    
that are next unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer that   
is beheaded in the valley:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood,  
neither have our eyes seen it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>  
8</H4></TD><TD><P>Be merciful, O YHVH, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast   
redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel's charge. And    
the blood shall be forgiven them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9>   
<H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from   
among you, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of YHVH.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>When thou goest      
forth to war against thine enemies, and YHVH thy ELOHIYM hath delivered them    
into thine hands, and thou hast taken them captive,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And seest among the captives a    
beautiful woman, and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy 
wife;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Then   
thou shalt bring her home to thine house, and she shall shave her head, and     
pare her nails;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall       
remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and   
after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy  
wife.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And it 
shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither    
she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not make     
merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>If a man have two wives, one      
beloved, and another hated, and they have born him children, both the beloved   
and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated:</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Then it shall be, when he 
maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of  
the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, which is indeed the          
firstborn:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>  
But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn, by giving him  
a double portion of all that he hath: for he is the beginning of his strength;  
the right of the firstborn is his.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18> 
<H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will  
not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when    
they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Then shall his father and his     
mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto 
the gate of his place;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is     
stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a     
drunkard.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt  
thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And if a man have    
committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang    
him on a tree:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any     
wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of ELOHIYM;) that    
thy land be not defiled, which YHVH thy ELOHIYM giveth thee for an              
inheritance.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John
