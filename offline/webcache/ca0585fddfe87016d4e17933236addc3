<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>Now the Philistines fought      
against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and     
fell down slain in mount Gilboa.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>
2</H4></TD><TD><P>And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his   
sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons 
of Saul.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded  
of the archers.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through    
therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armourbearer     
would not; for he was sore afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And when his      
armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and         
died.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>So Saul  
died, and his three sons, and all his house died together.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And when all the men of Israel that 
were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead,    
then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in 
them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And it   
came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that  
they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they had stripped him,     
they took his head, and his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines    
round about, to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And they put his armor in 
the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And when all         
Jabeshgilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>They arose, all the valiant   
men, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought    
them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted      
seven days.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P> 
So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against YHVH, even        
against the word of YHVH, which he kept not, and also for asking counsel of one 
that had a familiar spirit, to enquire of it;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And inquired not of YHVH: therefore he slew  
him, and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
