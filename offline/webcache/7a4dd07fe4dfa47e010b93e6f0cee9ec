1</H4></TD><TD><P>The word of YHVH came again unto me, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Son of man, say unto the prince 
of Tyrus, Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH; Because thine heart is lifted up, and     
thou hast said, I am a EL, I sit in the seat of ELOHIYM, in the midst of the    
seas; yet thou art a man, and not EL, though thou set thine heart as the heart  
of ELOHIYM:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Behold, thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that they can hide from  
thee:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>With thy 
wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast      
gotten gold and silver into thy treasures:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>By thy great wisdom and by thy traffick hast thou 
increased thy riches, and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches:</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore thus    
saith the ADONAY YHVH; Because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of        
ELOHIYM;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>      
Behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of the         
nations: and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and 
they shall defile thy brightness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8>   
<H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die 
the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Wilt thou yet say before him    
that slayeth thee, I am ELOHIYM? but thou shalt be a man, and no EL, in the     
hand of him that slayeth thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4> 
10</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand   
of strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the ADONAY YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover the word of YHVH came    
unto me, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto   
him, Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH; Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and   
perfect in beauty.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Thou hast been in Eden the garden of ELOHIYM; every precious stone was   
thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the 
jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship 
of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast  
created.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast   
upon the holy mountain of ELOHIYM; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of 
the stones of fire.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till  
iniquity was found in thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>    
16</H4></TD><TD><P>By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the     
midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee   
as profane out of the mountain of ELOHIYM: and I will destroy thee, O covering  
cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Thine heart was lifted up because of thy     
beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast 
thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou hast       
defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity   
of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it 
shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight   
of all them that behold thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>  
19</H4></TD><TD><P>All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished 
at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Again the word of YHVH    
came unto me, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>Son of man, set thy face against Zidon, and prophesy against it,</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And say, Thus   
saith the ADONAY YHVH; Behold, I am against thee, O Zidon; and I will be        
glorified in the midst of thee: and they shall know that I am YHVH, when I      
shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>For I will send into 
her pestilence, and blood into her streets; and the wounded shall be judged in  
the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that  
I am YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor any   
grieving thorn of all that are round about them, that despised them; and they   
shall know that I am the ADONAY YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH; When I shall have   
gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered, and 
shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then shall they dwell  
in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And they shall dwell safely       
therein, and shall build houses, and plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell     
with confidence, when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise     
them round about them; and they shall know that I am YHVH their ELOHIYM.</P>
