<p>1. Come hither, Indra, with thy Bays, come thou to Ka&#7751;va's eulogy.<br> Ye by command of yonder Dyaus, God bright by day! have gone to heaven.<br> 2 May the stone draw thee as it speaks, the Soma-stone with ringing voice.<br> Ye by command of yonder Dyaus, God bright by day! have gone to heaven.<br> 3 The stones' rim shakes the Soma here like a wolf worrying a sheep.<br> Ye by command of yonder Dyaus, God bright by day! have gone to heaven.<br> 4 The Ka&#7751;vas call thee hitherward for succour and to win the spoil.<br> Ye by command of yonder Dyaus, God bright by day! have gone to heaven.<br> 5 I set for thee, as for the Strong, the first draught of the juices shed.<br> 6 Come with abundant blessings, come with perfect care to succour us.<br> 7 Come, Lord of lofty thought, who hast infinite wealth and countless aids.<br> 8 Adorable mid Gods, the Priest good to mankind shall bring thee near.<br> 9 As wings the falcon, so thy Bays rushing in joy shall carry thee.<br> 10 Come from the enemy to us, to svaha and the Soma-draught.<br> 11 Come hither with thine car inclined to hear, take pleasure in our lauds.<br> 12 Lord of well-nourished Horses, come with well-fed Steeds alike in hue.<br> 13 Come hither from the mountains, come from regions of the sea of air.<br> 14 Disclose to us O Hero, wealth in thousands both of kine and steeds.<br> 15 Bring riches hitherward to us in hundreds, thousands, myriads.<br> Ye by command of yonder Dyaus, God bright by day! have gone to heaven.<br> 16 The thousand steeds, the mightiest troop, which we and Indra have received<br> From Vasurocis as a gift,<br> 17 The brown that match the wind in speed, and bright bay coursers fleet of foot,<br> Like Suns, resplendent are they all.<br> 18 Mid the Pargvata's rich gifts, swift steeds whose wheels run rapidly,<br> I seemed to stand amid a wood.</p>
