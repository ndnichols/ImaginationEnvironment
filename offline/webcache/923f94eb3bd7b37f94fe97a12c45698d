<p>1. I WILL declare, while juices flow, the manly deeds that ye have done:<br> Your Fathers, enemies of Gods, were smitten down, and, Indra-Agni, ye survive.<br> 2 Thus, Indra-Agnip verily your greatness merits loftiest praise,<br> Sprung from one common Father, brothers, twins are ye; your Mother is in every place.<br> 3 These who delight in flowing juice, like fellow horses at their food,<br> Indra and Agni, Gods armed with the thunderbolt, we call this day to come with help.<br> 4 Indra and Agni, Friends of Law, served with rich gifts, your speech is kind<br> To him who praises you while these libations flow: that man, O Gods, ye ne&#146;er consume.<br> 5 What mortal understands, O Gods, Indra and Agni, this your way?<br> One of you, yoking Steeds that move to every side, advances in your common car.<br> 6 First, Indra-Agni, hath this Maid come footless unto those with feet.<br> Stretching her head and speaking loudly with her tongue, she hath gone downward thirty steps.<br> 7 E&#146;en now, O Indra-Agni, men hold in their arms and stretch their bows.<br> Desert us not in this great fray, in battles for the sake of kine.<br> 8 The foeman's sinful enmities, Indra and Agni, vex me sore.<br> Drive those who hate me far away, and keep them distant from the Sun.<br> 9 Indra and Agni, yours are all the treasures of the heavens and earth.<br> Here give ye us the opulence that prospers every living man.<br> 10 O Indra-Agni, who accept the laud, and hear us for our praise,<br> Come near us, drawn by all our songs, to drink of this our Soma juice.</p>
