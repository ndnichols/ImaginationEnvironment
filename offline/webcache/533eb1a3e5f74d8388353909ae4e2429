<p>1. HIGH hymns have sounded forth the praise of Maghavan, supporter of mankind, of Indra meet for lauds;<br> Him who hath waxen great, invoked with beauteous songs, Immortal One, whose praise each day is sung aloud.<br> 2 To Indra from all sides go forth my songs of praise, the Lord of Hundred Powers, strong, Hero, like the sea,<br> Swift, winner of the booty, breaker-down of forts, faithful and ever-glorious, finder of the light.<br> 3 Where battle's spoil is piled the singer winneth praise, for Indra taketh care of matchless worshippers.<br> He in Vivasv&#257;n's dwelling findeth his delight: praise thou the ever-conquering slayer of the foe.<br> 4 Thee, valorous, most heroic of the heroes, shall the priests glorify with songg and praises.<br> Full of all wondrous power he goes to conquest: worship is his, sole Lord from days aforetime.<br> 5 Abundant are the gifts he gives to mortals: for him the earth bears a rich store of treasures.<br> The heavens, the growing plants, the living waters, the forest trees preserve their wealth for Indra.<br> 6 To thee, O Indra, Lord of Bays, for ever are offered prayers and songs: accept them gladly.<br> As Kinsman think thou of some fresh assistance; good Friend, give strength and life to those who praise thee.<br> 7 Here, Indra, drink thou Soma with the Maruts, as thou didst drink the juice beside &#346;&#257;ry&#257;ta.<br> Under thy guidance, in thy keeping, Hero, the singers serve, skilled in fair sacrifices.<br> 8 So eagerly desirous drink the Soma, our juice, O Indra, with thy friends the Maruts,<br> Since at thy birth all Deities adorned thee for the great fight, O thou invoked of many.<br> 9 He was your comrade in your zeal, O Maruts: they, rich in noble gifts, rejoiced in Indra.<br> With them together let the V&#7771;tra-slayer drink in his home the worshipper's libation.<br> 10 So, Lord of affluent gifts, this juice hath been pressed for thee with strength<br> Drink of it, thou who lovest song.<br> 11 Incline thy body to this juice which suits thy Godlike nature well:<br> May it cheer thee who lovest it.<br> 12 Brave Indra, let it work through both thy flanks, and through thy head by prayer,<br> And through thine arms, to prosper us.</p>
