<p>1. YONDER goes up that light: your chariot is yoked that travels round upon the summit of this heaven.<br> Within this car are stored three kindred shares of food, and a skin filled with meath is rustling as the fourth.<br> 2 Forth come your viands rich with store of pleasant meath, and cars and horses at the flushing of the dawn,<br> Stripping the covering from the surrounded gloom, and spreading through mid-air bright radiance like the Sun.<br> 3 Drink of the meath with lips accustomed to the draught; harness for the meath's sake the chariot that ye love.<br> Refresh the way ye go, refresh the paths with meath: hither, O A&#347;vins, bring the skin that holds the meath.<br> 4 The swans ye have are friendly, rich in store of meath, gold-pinioned, strong to draw, awake at early morn,<br> Swimming the flood, exultant, fain for draughts that cheer: ye come like flies to our libations of the meath.<br> 5 Well knowing solemn rites and rich in meath, the fires sing to the morning A&#347;vins at the break of day,<br> When with pure hands the prudent energetic priest hath with the stones pressed out the Soma rich in meath.<br> 6 The rays advancing nigh, chasing with day the gloom, spread through the firmament bright radiance like the Sun;<br> And the Sun harnessing his horses goeth forth: ye through your Godlike nature let his paths be known.<br> 7 Devout in thought I have declared, O A&#347;vins, your chariot with good steeds, which lasts for ever,<br> Wherewith ye travel swiftly through the regions to the prompt worshipper who brings oblation.</p>
