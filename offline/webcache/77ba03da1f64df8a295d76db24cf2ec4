Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the       
Apostle and High Priest of our profession, MASHIYACH YAHSHUA;</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Who was faithful to him that    
appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>For this man was counted worthy 
of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more   
honour than the house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all       
things is ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a      
testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>But MASHIYACH as a son over his own 
house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of  
the hope firm unto the end.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>

his voice,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the  
wilderness:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>   
When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore I was      
grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and   
they have not known my ways.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>   
11</H4></TD><TD><P>So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my         
rest.)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Take  
heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in       
departing from the living EL.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>  
13</H4></TD><TD><P>But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day;     
lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>For we are made partakers of  
MASHIYACH, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>While it is     
said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the       
provocation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>
For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of    
Egypt by Moses.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD>
<P>But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had      
sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And to whom sware he that they should not    
enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>So we see that they could not     
enter in because of unbelief.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
