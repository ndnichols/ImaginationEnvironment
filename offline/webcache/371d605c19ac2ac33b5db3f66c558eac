we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>But have renounced the      
hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word   
of ELOHIYM deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves  
to every man's conscience in the sight of EL.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them    
that are lost:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>
In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, 
lest the light of the glorious gospel of MASHIYACH, who is the image of         
ELOHIYM, should shine unto them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>

ADONAY; and ourselves your servants for YAHSHUA' sake.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>For ELOHIYM, who commanded the      
light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of 
the knowledge of the glory of EL in the face of YAHSHUA MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>But we have this treasure   
in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of EL, and not of   
us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>We are

Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Always bearing about in the
