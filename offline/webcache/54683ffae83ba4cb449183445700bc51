And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and        
embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he had gone over those     
parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And there abode three       
months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into       
Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of 
Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe,  
and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>These going before tarried for us   
at Troas.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto  
them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And upon the first day of the week, 
when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready 
to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And there were many lights  
in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And there sat in a window a certain 
young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long  
preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was  
taken up dead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not     
yourselves; for his life is in him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11>
<H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>When he therefore was come up again, and had broken      
bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he        
departed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And we went before   
to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he  
appointed, minding himself to go afoot.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he met with us at Assos, we took him   
in, and came to Mitylene.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>      
15</H4></TD><TD><P>And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against     
Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the 
next day we came to Miletus.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>   
16</H4></TD><TD><P>For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would 
not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be   
at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17> 
<H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the      
elders of the church.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from    
the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at  
all seasons,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>
Serving YHVH with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations,   
which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And how I kept back nothing that  
was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly,    
and from house to house,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance     
toward ELOHIYM, and faith toward our ADONAY YAHSHUA MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And now, behold, I go bound   
in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me       
there:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Save  
that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions 
abide me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>   
But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so  
that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received 
of the ADONAY YAHSHUA, to testify the gospel of the grace of ELOHIYM.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And now, behold, I   
know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of EL, shall see 
my face no more.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood   
of all men.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P> 
For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of ELOHIYM.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Take heed therefore  
unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made  
you overseers, to feed the church of ELOHIYM, which he hath purchased with his  
own blood.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>  
For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among   
you, not sparing the flock.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>    
30</H4></TD><TD><P>Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse   
things, to draw away disciples after them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore watch, and remember, that by the      
space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with          
tears.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
now, brethren, I commend you to ELOHIYM, and to the word of his grace, which is 
able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are   
sanctified.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P> 
I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>Yea, ye yourselves know, that     
these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with     
me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>I have   
shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and  
to remember the words of the ADONAY YAHSHUA, how he said, It is more blessed to 
give than to receive.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them  
all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And     
they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him,</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>Sorrowing most of all for the 
words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they           
accompanied him unto the ship.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
