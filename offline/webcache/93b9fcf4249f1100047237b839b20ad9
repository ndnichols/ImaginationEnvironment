<p>1. AGNI, erect, hath shown enriching favour: the flame goes forward to the Gods&#146; assembly.<br> Like car-borne men the stones their path have chosen: let the priest, quickened, celebrate our worship.<br> 2 Soft to the tread, their sacred grass is scattered: these go like Kings amid the band around them,<br> At the folks early call on Night and Morning,&#151;V&#257;yu, and P&#363;&#7779;an with his team, to bless us.<br> 3 Here on their path the noble Gods proceeded: in the wide firmament the Beauteous decked them.<br> Bend your way hither, ye who travel widely: hear this our envoy who hath gone to meet you.<br> 4 For they are holy aids at sacrifices: all Gods approach the place of congregation.<br> Bring these, desirous, to our worship, Agni, swift the Nisatyas, Bhaga, and Purandhi.<br> 5 Agni, to these men's hymns, from earth, from heaven, bring Mitra, Varu&#7751;a, Indra, and Agni,<br> And Aryaman, and Aditi, and Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Sarasvat&#299; be joyful, and the Maruts.<br> 6 Even as the holy wish, the gift is offered: may he, unsated, come when men desire him.<br> Give never-failing ever-conquering riches: with Gods for our allies may we be victors.<br> 7 Now have both worlds been praised by the Vasisthas; and holy Mitra, Varu&#7751;a, and Agni.<br> May they, bright Deities, make our song supremest. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
