foundations of the earth: for YHVH hath a controversy with his people, and he   
will plead with Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4>

out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and          
Miriam.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>O my   
people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son 
of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the             
righteousness of YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4>

sin of my soul?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth YHVH require of      
thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy          
ELOHIYM?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>
