<p>1. MAY our divine and brilliant hymn go forth, like a swift chariot wrought and fashioned well.<br> 2 The waters listen as they flow along: they know the origin of heaven and earth.<br> 3 Yea, the broad waters swell their flood ior him: of him strong heroes think amid their foes.<br> 4 Set ye for him the coursers to the pole: like Indra Thunderer is the Golden-armed.<br> 5 Arouse you, like the days, to sacrifice speed gladly like a traveller on the way.<br> 6 Go swift to battles, to the sacrifice: set up a flag, a hero for the folk.<br> 7 Up from his strength hath risen as &#146;twere a light: it bears the load as earth bears living things.<br> 8 Agni, no demon I invoke the Gods: by law completing it, I form a hymn.<br> 9 Closely albout you lay your heavenly song, and send your voice to where the Gods abide.<br> 10 Varu&#7751;a, Mighty, with a thousand eyes, beholds the paths wherein these rivers run.<br> 11 He, King of kings, the glory of the floods, o&#146;er all that liveth hath resistless sway.<br> 12 May he assist us among all the tribes, and make the envier's praise devoid of light.<br> 13 May the foes' threatening arrow pass us by: may he put far from us our bodies' sin.<br> 14 Agni, oblation-cater, through our prayers aid us: to him our dearest laud is brought.<br> 15 Accordant with the Gods choose for our Friend the Waters&#146; Child: may he be good to us.<br> 16 With lauds I sing the Dragon born of floods: he sits beneath the streams in middle air.<br> 17 Ne&#146;er may the Dragon of the Deep harm us: ne&#146;er fail this faithful servant's sacrifice.<br> 18 To these our heroes may they grant renown: may pious men march boldly on to wealth.<br> 19 Leading great hosts, with fierce attacks of these, they burn their foes as the Sun burns the earth.<br> 20 What time our wives draw near to us, may he, left-handed Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar, give us hero sons.<br> 21 May Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar find our hymn acceptable, and may Aramati, seeking wealth, be ours.<br> 22 May they who lavish gifts bestow those treasures: may Rodas&#299; and Varu&#7751;&#257;n&#299; listen.<br> May he, with the Var&#363;tr&#299;s, be our refuge, may bountiful Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar give us store of riches.<br> 23 So may rich Mountains and the liberal Waters, so may all Herbs that grow on ground, and Heaven,<br> And Earth accordant with the Forest-Sovrans, and both the World-halves round about protect us.<br> 24 To this may both the wide Worlds lend approval, and Varu&#7751;a in heaven, whose Friend is Indra.<br> May all the Maruts give consent, the Victors, that we may hold great wealth in firm possession.<br> 25 May Indra, Varu&#7751;a, Mitra, and Agni, Waters, Herbs, Trees accept the praise we offer.<br> May we find refuge in the Marut's bosom. Protect us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
