<p>1. How, Agni, have the radiant ones, aspiring, endued thee with the vigour of the living,<br> So that on both sides fostering seed and offspring, the Gods may joy in Holy Law's fulfilment?<br> 2 Mark this my speech, Divine One, thou, Most Youthful! offered to thee by him who gives most freely.<br> One hates thee, and another sings thy praises: I thine adorer laud thy form, O Agni.<br> 3 Thy guardian rays, O Agni, when they saw him, preserved blind M&#257;mateya from affliction.<br> Lord of all riches, he preserved the pious the foes who fain would harm them did no mischief.<br> 4 The sinful man who worships not, O Agni, who, offering not, harms us with double-dealing,&#151;<br> Be this in turn to him a heavy sentence: may he distress himself by his revilings.<br> 5 Yea, when a mortal knowingly, O Victor, injures with double tongue a fellow-mortal,<br> From him, praised Agni! save thou him that lauds thee: bring us not into trouble and affliction.</p>
