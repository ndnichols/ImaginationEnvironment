<p>1. PRESSED is the juice divine with milk commingled: thereto hath Indra ever been accustomed.<br> We wake thee, Lord of Bays, with sacrifices: mark this our laud in the wild joy of Soma.<br> 2 On to the rite they move, the grass they scatter, these Soma-drinkers eloquent in synod.<br> Hither, for men to grasp, are brought the press-stones, far-thundering, famous, strong, that wait on heroes.<br> 3 Indra, thou settest free the many waters that were encompassed, Hero, by the Dragon.<br> Down rolled, as if on chariots borne, the rivers: through fear of thee all things created tremble.<br> 4 Skilled in all manly deeds the God terrific hath with his weapons mastered these opponents.<br> Indra in rapturous joy shook down their castles he slew them in his might, the Thunder-wielder.<br> 5 No evil spirits have impelled us, Indra, nor fiends, O Mightiest God, with their devices.<br> Let our true God subdue the hostile rabble: let not the lewd approach our holy worship.<br> 6 Thou in thy strength surpassest Earth and Heaven: the regions comprehend not all thy greatness.<br> With thine own power and might thou slewest V&#7771;tra: no foe hath found the end of thee in battle.<br> 7 Even the earlier Deities submitted their powers to thy supreme divine dominion.<br> Indra wins wealth and deals it out to other's: men in the strife for booty call on Indra.<br> 8 The humble hath invoked thee for protection, thee, Lord of great felicity, O Indra.<br> Thou with a hundred aids hast been our Helper: one who brings gifts like thee hath his defender.<br> 9 May we, O Indra, be thy friends for ever, eagerly, Conqueror, yielding greater homage.<br> May, through thy grace, the strength of us who battle quell in the shock the onset of the foeman.<br> 10 Place us by food which thou hast given, O Indra, us and the wealthy patrons who command us.<br> Let thy great power bring good to him who lauds thee. Ye Gods, preserve us evermore with blessings.</p>
