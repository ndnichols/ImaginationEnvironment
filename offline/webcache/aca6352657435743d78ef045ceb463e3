<p>1. MAY they who would assume kinship from far away, Vivasv&#257;n's generations, dearly loved of men,<br> Even the Gods who sit upon the sacred grass of Nahu&#7779;a's son Yay&#257;ti, bless and comfort us.<br> 2 For worthy of obeisance, Gods, are all your names, worthy of adoration and of sacrifice.<br> Ye who were born from waters, and from Aditi, and from the earth, do ye here listen to my call.<br> 3 I will rejoice in these &#256;dityas for my weal, for whom the Mother pours forth water rich in balm,<br> And Dyaus the Infinite, firm as a rock, sweet milk,&#151;Gods active, strong through lauds, whose might the Bull upholds.<br> 4 Looking on men, ne&#146;er slumbering, they by their deserts attained as Gods to lofty immortality.<br> Borne on refulgent cars, sinless, with serpents' powers, they robe them, for our welfare, in the height of heaven.<br> 5 Great Kings who bless us, who have come to sacrifice, who, ne&#146;er assailed, have set their mansion in the sky,&#151;<br> These I invite with adoration and with hymns, mighty &#256;dityas, Aditi, for happiness.<br> 6 Who offereth to you the laud that ye accept, O ye All-Gods of Manu, many as ye are?<br> Who, Mighty Ones, will prepare for you the sacrifice to bear us over trouble to felicity?<br> 7 Ye to whom Manu, by seven priests, with kindled fire, offered the first oblation with his heart and soul,<br> Vouchsafe us, ye &#256;dityas, sheitcr free from fear, and make us good and easy paths to happiness.<br> 8 Wise Deities, who have dominion o&#146;er the world, ye thinkers over all that moves not and that moves,<br> Save us from uncommitted and committed sin, preserve us from all sin to-day for happiness.<br> 9 In battles we invoke Indra still swift to hear, and all the holy Host of Heaven who banish grief,<br> Agni, Mitra, and Varu&#7751;a that we may gain, Dyays, Bhaga, Maruts, Prthivi for happiness:<br> 10 Mightily-saving Earth, incomparable Heaven the good guide Aditi who gives secure defence<br> The well-oared heavenly Ship that lets no waters in, free from defect, will we ascend for happiness.<br> 11 Bless us, all Holy Ones, that we may have your help, guard and protect us from malignant injury.<br> With fruitful invocation may we call on you, Gods, who give ear to us for grace, for happiness.<br> 12 Keep all disease afar and sordid sacrifice, keep off the wicked man's malicious enmity.<br> Keep far away from us all hatred, O ye Gods, and give us ample shelter for our happiness.<br> 13 Untouched by any evil, every mortal thrives, and, following the Law, spreads in his progeny.<br> Whom ye with your good guidance, O &#256;dityas, lead safely through all his pain and grief to happiness.<br> 14 That which ye guard and grace in battle, O ye Gods, ye Maruts, where the prize is wealth, where heroes win,<br> That conquering Car, O Indra, that sets forth at dawn, that never breaks, may we ascend for happiness.<br> 15 Vouchsafe us blessing in our paths and desert tracts, blessing in waters and in battle, for the light;<br> Blessing upon the wombs that bring male children forth, and blessing, O ye Maruts, for the gain of wealth.<br> 16 The noblest Svasti with abundant riches, who comes to what is good by distant pathway,&#151;<br> May she at home and far away preserve us, and dwell with us under the Gods&#146; protection<br> 17 Thus hatb the thoughtful sage, the son of Plati, praised you, O Aditi and all &#256;dityas,<br> Men are made rich by those who are Immortal: the Heavenly Folk have been extolled by Gaya.</p>
