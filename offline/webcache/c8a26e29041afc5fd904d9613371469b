of ELOHIYM which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in MASHIYACH        
YAHSHUA, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name   
of YAHSHUA MASHIYACH our ADONAY, both their's and our's:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Even as the testimony of

</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Now I beseech   
you, brethren, by the name of our ADONAY YAHSHUA MASHIYACH, that ye all speak   
the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be        
perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>For it hath been     
declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe,  
that there are contentions among you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Is MASHIYACH divided? was 
Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>I thank EL that I         
baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

own name.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I   
baptized any other.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD>
<TD><P>For MASHIYACH sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with 
wisdom of words, lest the cross of MASHIYACH should be made of none effect.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>For the         
preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which    
are saved it is the power of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of 
the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Where is the wise?   
where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not ELOHIYM made 
foolish the wisdom of this world?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21>  
<H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>For after that in the wisdom of ELOHIYM the world by     
wisdom knew not EL, it pleased EL by the foolishness of preaching to save them  
that believe.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>But we preach MASHIYACH   
crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>But unto them   
which are called, both Jews and Greeks, MASHIYACH the power of ELOHIYM, and the 
wisdom of EL.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Because the foolishness of ELOHIYM is wiser than men; and the weakness of EL 
is stronger than men.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after 
the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>But ELOHIYM hath chosen the       
foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and EL hath chosen the weak   
things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And base things of the world, 
and things which are despised, hath ELOHIYM chosen, yea, and things which are   
not, to bring to nought things that are:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>That no flesh should glory in his presence.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>But of him are  
ye in MASHIYACH YAHSHUA, who of ELOHIYM is made unto us wisdom, and             
righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>That, according as it is written, 
He that glorieth, let him glory in YHVH.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software
