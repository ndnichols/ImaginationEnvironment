<p>1. BRING adoration ample and most excellent, hymn, offerings, to the watchful Twain, the bountiful, your sweetest to the bounteous Ones.<br> Sovrans adored with streams of oil and praised at every sacrifice.<br> Their high imperial might may nowhere be assailed, ne&#146;er may their Godhead be assailed.<br> 2 For the broad Sun was seen a path more widely laid, the path of holy law hath been maintained with rays, the eye with Bhaga's rays of light.<br> Firm-set in heaven is Mitra's home, and Aryaman's and Varu&#7751;a's.<br> Thence they give forth great vital strength which merits praise, high power of life that men shall praise.<br> 3 With Aditi the luminous, the celestial, upholder of the people, come ye day by day, ye who watch sleepless, day by day.<br> Resplendent might have ye obtained, &#256;dityas, Lords of liberal gifts.<br> Movers of men, mild both, are Mitra, Varu&#7751;a, mover of men is Aryaman.<br> 4 This Soma be most sweet to Mitra, Varu&#7751;a: he in the drinking-feasts, shall have a share thereof, sharing, a God, among the Gods.<br> May all the Gods of one accord accept it joyfully to-day.<br> Therefore do ye, O Kings, accomplish what we ask, ye Righteous Ones, whate&#146;er we ask.<br> 5 Whoso, with worship serves Mitra and Varu&#7751;a, him guard ye carefully, uninjured, from distress, guard from distress the liberal man.<br> Aryaman guards him well who acts uprightly following his law,<br> Who beautifies their service with his lauds, who makes it beautiful with songs of praise.<br> 6 Worship will I profess to lofty Dyaus, to Heaven and Earth, to Mitra and to bounteous Varu&#7751;a, the Bounteous, the Compassionate.<br> Praise Indra, praise thou Agni, praise Bhaga and heavenly Aryaman.<br> Long may we live and have attendant progeny, have progeny with Soma's help.<br> 7 With the Gods&#146; help, with Indra still beside us, may we be held self-splendid with the Maruts.<br> May Agni, Mitra, Varu&#7751;a give us shelter this may we gain, we and our wealthy princes.</p>
