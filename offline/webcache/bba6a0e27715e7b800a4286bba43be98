Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of MASHIYACH, let us go on     
unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, 
and of faith toward ELOHIYM,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>    
2</H4></TD><TD><P>Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and   
of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And this will we do, if EL          
permit.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>For it 
is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the       
heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And have tasted the good word of    
ELOHIYM, and the powers of the world to come,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>If they shall fall away, to renew them again   
unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of ELOHIYM afresh,   
and put him to an open shame.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>   
7</H4></TD><TD><P>For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon 
it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth     
blessing from ELOHIYM:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh   
unto cursing; whose end is to be burned.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of   
you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>For ELOHIYM is not        
unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward 
his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And we desire that   
every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto  
the end:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>    
That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience   
inherit the promises.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>For when ELOHIYM made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by 
no greater, he sware by himself,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14>   
<H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and           
multiplying I will multiply thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15>  
<H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the  
promise.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>For 
men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end 
of all strife.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>Wherein ELOHIYM, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise   
the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>That by two immutable things, in  
which it was impossible for ELOHIYM to lie, we might have a strong consolation, 
who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Which hope we have as an  
anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within 
the veil;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even YAHSHUA, made an high priest for 
ever after the order of Melchisedec.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
