<p>1. WHERE is that Hero? Who hath looked on Indra borne on light-rolling car by Tawny Coursers,<br> Who, Thunderer, seeks with wealth the Soma-presser, and to his house goes, much-invoked, to aid him?<br> 2 I have beheld his strong and secret dwelling, longing have sought the Founder's habitation.<br> I asked of others, and they said in answer, May we, awakened men, attain to Indra.<br> 3 We will tell, Indra, when we pour libation, what mighty deeds thou hast performed to please us.<br> Let him who knows not learn, who knows them listen: hither rides Maghavan with all his army.<br> 4 Indra, when born, thou madest firm thy spirit: alone thou seekest war to fight with many.<br> With might thou clavest e&#146;en the rock asunder, and foundest out the stable of the Milch-kine.<br> 5 When thou wast born supremest at a distance, bearing a name renowned in far-off regions,<br> Since then e&#146;en Gods have been afraid of Indra: he conquered all the floods which served the D&#257;sa.<br> 6 These blissful Maruts sing their psalm to praise thee, and pour to thee libation of the Soma.<br> Indra with wondrous powers subdued the Dragon, the guileful lurker who beset the waters.<br> 7 Thou, Maghavan, from the first didst scatter foemen, speeding, while joying in the milk, the Giver.<br> There, seeking man's prosperity, thou torest away the head of Namuci the D&#257;sa.<br> 8 Pounding the head of Namuci the D&#257;sa, me, too thou madest thine associate, Indra!<br> Yea, and the rolling stone that is in heaven both worlds, as on a car, brought to the Maruts.<br> 9 Women for weapons hath the D&#257;sa taken, What injury can his feeble armies To me?<br> Well he distinguished his two different voices, and Indra then advanced to fight the Dasyu.<br> 10 Divided from their calves the Cows went lowing around, on every side, hither and thither.<br> These Indra re-united with his helpers, what time the well-pressed Soma made him joyful.<br> 11 What time the Somas mixed by Babhru cheered him, loud the Steer bellowed in his habitations.<br> So Indra drank thereof, the Fort-destroyer, and gave him guerdon, in return, of milch-kine.<br> 12 This good deed have the Rusamas done, Agni! that they have granted me four thousand cattle.<br> We have received Rnancaya's wealth, of heroes the most heroic, which was freely offered.<br> 13 The Rusamas, O Agni, sent me homeward with fair adornment and with kine in thousands.<br> The strong libations have made Indra joyful, when night, whose course was ending, changed to morning.<br> 14 Night, well-nigh ended, at Rnancaya's coming, King of the Rusamas, was changed to morning.<br> Like a strong courser, fleet of foot, urged onward, Babhru hath gained four thousand as his guerdon.<br> 15 We have received four thousand head of cattle presented by the Rusamas, O Agni.<br> And we, the singers, have received the caldron of metal which was heated for Pravargya.</p>
