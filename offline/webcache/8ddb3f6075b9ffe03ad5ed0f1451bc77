<p>1. The Soma hath been pressed for thee, O Indra; mightiest, bold One, come.<br> May Indra-vigour fill thee full, as the Sun fills mid-air with rays.<br> 2 His pair of Tawny Coursers bring Indra of unresisted might<br> Hither to &#7770;&#7779;is&#146; songs of praise and sacrifice performed by men.<br> 3 Slayer of V&#7771;tra, mount thy car; thy Bay Steeds have been yoked by prayer.<br> May, with its voice, the pressing-stone draw thine attention hitherward.<br> 4 This poured libation, Indra, drink, immortal, gladdening, excellent.<br> Streams of the bright have flowed to thee here at the seat of holy Law.<br> 5 Sing glory now to Indra, say to him your solemn eulogies.<br> The drops poured forth have made him glad: pay reverence to his might supreme.<br> 6 When, Indra, thou dost yoke thy Steeds, there is no better charioteer:<br> None hath surpassed thee in thy might, none with good steeds o&#146;ertaken thee.<br> 7 He who alone bestoweth on mortal man who offereth gifts,<br> The ruler of resistless power, is Indra, sure.<br> 8 When will he trample, like a weed, the man who hath no gift for him?<br> When, verily, will Indra hear our songs of praise?<br> 9 He who with Soma juice prepared amid the many honours thee,&#151;<br> Verily Indra gains thereby tremendous might.<br> 10 The juice of Soma thus diffused, sweet to the taste, the bright cows drink,<br> Who for the sake of splendour close to mighty Indra's side rejoice, good in their own supremacy.<br> 11 Craving his touch the dappled kine mingle the Soma with their milk.<br> The milch-kine dear to Indra send forth his death-dealing thunderbolt, good in their own supremacy.<br> 12 With veneration, passing wise, honouring his victorious might,<br> They follow close his many laws to win them due preeminence, good in their<br> own supremacy.<br> 13 With bones of Dadhyach for his arms, Indra, resistless in attack,<br> Struck nine-and-ninety V&#7771;tras dead.<br> 14 He, searching for the horse's head, removed among the mountains, found<br> At &#346;arya&#7751;&#257;v&#257;n what he sought.<br> 15 Then verily they recognized the essential form of Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar's Bull,<br> Here in the mansion of the Moon.<br> 16 Who yokes to-day unto the pole of Order the strong and passionate steers of checkless spirit,<br> With shaft-armed mouths, heart-piercing, health-bestowing?<br> Long shall he live who richly pays their service.<br> 17 Who fleeth forth? who suffereth? who feareth? Who knoweth Indra present, Indra near us?<br> Who sendeth benediction on his offspring, his household, wealth and person, and the People?<br> 18 Who with poured oil and offering honours Agni, with ladle worships at appointed seasons?<br> To whom to the Gods bring oblation quickly? What offerer, God-favoured, knows him thoroughly?<br> 19 Thou as a God, O Mightiest, verily blessest mortal man.<br> O Maghavan, there is no comforter but thou: Indra, I speak my words to thee.<br> 20 Let not thy bounteous gifts, let not thy saving help fail us, good Lord, at any time;<br> And measure out to us, thou lover of mankind, all riches hitherward from men.</p>
