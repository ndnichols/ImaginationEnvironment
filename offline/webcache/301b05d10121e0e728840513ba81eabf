<TD><P>Forasmuch then as MASHIYACH hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm       
yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh  
hath ceased from sin;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD>
<TD><P>That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the   
lusts of men, but to the will of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>For the time past of our life may suffice us to   
have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, 
excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherein they think it  
strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of  
you:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Who shall 
give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>For for this cause was the  
gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according 
to men in the flesh, but live according to ELOHIYM in the spirit.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>But the end of all things   
is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And above all things have fervent   
charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Use hospitality   
one to another without grudging.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10>   
<H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>As every man hath received the gift, even so minister    
the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of ELOHIYM.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>If any man      
speak, let him speak as the oracles of YAH; if any man minister, let him do it  
as of the ability which EL giveth: that ELOHIYM in all things may be glorified  
through YAHSHUA MASHIYACH, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever.    
Amen.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>       
Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you,   
as though some strange thing happened unto you:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of 
MASHIYACH's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad  
also with exceeding joy.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4>
</TD><TD><P>If ye be reproached for the name of MASHIYACH, happy are ye; for    
the spirit of glory and of ELOHIYM resteth upon you: on their part he is evil   
spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as 
a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Yet if any man       
suffer as a MASHIYACHian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify ELOHIYM   
on this behalf.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD>
<P>For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of EL: and if it  
first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of    
ELOHIYM?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner      
appear?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>     
Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of ELOHIYM commit the      
keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.</P>
