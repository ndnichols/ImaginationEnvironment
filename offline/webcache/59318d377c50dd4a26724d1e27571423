<p>1. HE hath arrived, he whom we sought with longing, who skilled in sacrifice well knows its courses.<br> Let him discharge his sacrificial duties: let him sit down as Friend who was before<br> Us.<br> 2 Best Priest, he hath been won by being seated, for he hath looked on the well-ordered viands.<br> Come, let usworship Gods who must be worshipped, and pouring oil, laud those who should be lauded.<br> 3 Now hath he made the feast of Gods effective: now have we found the secret tongue of worship.<br> Now hath he come, sweet, robed in vital vigour, and made our calling on the Gods effective.<br> 4 This prelude of my speech I now will utter, whereby we Gods may quell our Asura foemen.<br> Eaters of strengthening food who merit worship, O ye Five Tribes, be pleased with mine oblation.<br> 5 May the Five Tribes be pleased with mine oblation, and the Cow's Sons and all who merit worship.<br> From earthly trouble may the earth protect us, and air's mid realm from woe that comes from heaven.<br> 6 Spinning the thread, follow the region's splendid light: guard thou the path ways well which wisdom hath prepared.<br> Weave ye the knotless labour of the bards who sing: be Manu thou, and bring the Heavenly People forth.<br> 7 Lovers of Soma, bind the chariot traces fast: set ye the reins in order and embellish them.<br> Bring hitherward the car with seats where eight may sit, whereon the Gods have brought the treasure that we love.<br> 8 Here flows Asmanvati: hold fast each other, keep yourselves up, and pass, my friends, the river.<br> There let us leave the Powers that brought no profit, and cross the flood to Powers that are auspicious.<br> 9 Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar, most deft of workmen, knew each magic art, bringing most blessed bowls that hold the drink of Gods.<br> His axe, wrought of good metal, he is sharpening now, wherewith the radiant Brahma&#7751;aspati will cut.<br> 10 Now, O ye Sapient Ones, make ye the axes sharp wherewith ye fashion bowls to hold the Am&#7771;ta.<br> Knowing the secret places make ye ready that whereby the Gods have gotten immortality.<br> 11 Ye with a secret tongue and dark intention laid the maiden deep within, the calf within the mouth.<br> They evermore are near us with their gracious help: successful is the song that strives for victory.</p>
