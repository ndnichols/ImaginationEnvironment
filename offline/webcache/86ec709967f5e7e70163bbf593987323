<p>1. THOU, Agni, even as Mitra, hast a princely glory of thine own.<br> Thou, active Vasu, makest fame increase like full prosperity.<br> 2 For, verily, men pray to thee with sacrifices and with songs.<br> To thee the Friendly Courser, seen of all, comes speeding through the air.<br> 3 Of one accord men kindle thee Heaven's signal of the sacrifice,<br> When, craving bliss, this race of man invites thee to the solemn rite.<br> 4 Let the man thrive who travails sore, in prayer, far thee the Bountiful.<br> He with the help of lofty Dyaus comes safe through straits of enmity.<br> 5 The mortal who with fuel lights thy flame and offers unto thee,<br> Supports a house with many a branch, Agni, to live a hundred years.<br> 6 Thy bright smoke lifts itself aloft, and far-extended shines in heaven.<br> For, Purifier! like the Sun thou beamest with thy radiant glow.<br> 7 For in men's houses thou must be glorified as a well-loved guest,<br> Gay like an elder in a fort, claiming protection like a son.<br> 8 Thou, Agni, like an able steed, art urged by wisdom in the wood.<br> Thou art like wind; food, home art thou, like a young horse that runs astray.<br> 9 E&#146;en things imperishable, thou, O Agni, like a gazing ox,<br> Eatest, when hosts, Eternal One! of thee the Mighty rend the woods.<br> 10 Agni, thou enterest as Priest the home of men who sacrifice.<br> Lord of the people, prosper them. Accept the ofrering, A&#7749;giras!<br> 11 O Agni, God with Mitra's might, call hither the favour of the Gods from earth and heaven.<br> Bring weal from heaven, that men may dwell securely. May we o&#146;ercome the foe's malign oppressions, may we o&#146;ercome them, through thy help o&#146;ercome them.</p>
