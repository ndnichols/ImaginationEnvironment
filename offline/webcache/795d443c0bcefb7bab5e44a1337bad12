<p>1. FORTH from the bosom of the mountains, eager as two swift mares with loosened rein contending,<br> Like two bright mother cows who lick their youngling, Vip&#257;&#347; and Sutudri speed down their waters.<br> 2 Impelled by Indra whom ye pray to urge you, ye move as &#146;twere on chariots to the ocean.<br> Flowing together, swelling with your billows, O lucid Streams, each of you seeks the other.<br> 3 I have attained the most maternal River, we have approached Vip&#257;&#347;, the broad, the blessed.<br> Licking as &#146;twere their calf the pair of Mothers flow onward to their common home together.<br> 4 We two who rise and swell with billowy waters move forward to the home which Gods have made us.<br> Our flood may not be stayed when urged to motion. What would the singer, calling to the Rivers?<br> 5 Linger a little at my friendly bidding rest, Holy Ones, a moment in your journey.<br> With hymn sublime soliciting your favour Ku&#347;ika's son hath called unto the River.<br> 6 Indra who wields the thunder dug our channels: he smote down V&#7771;tra, him who stayed our currents.<br> Savitar, God, the lovely-handed, led us, and at his sending forth we flow expanded.<br> 7 That hero deed of Indra must be lauded for ever that he rent Ahi in pieces.<br> He smote away the obstructors with his thunder, and eager for their course forth flowed the waters.<br> 8 Never forget this word of thine, O singer, which future generations shall reecho.<br> In hymns, O bard, show us thy loving kindness. Humble us not mid men. To thee be honour!<br> 9 List quickly, Sisters, to the bard who cometh to you from far away with car and wagon.<br> Bow lowly down; be easy to be traversed stay, Rivers, with your floods below our axles.<br> 10 Yea, we will listen to thy words, O singer. With wain and car from far away thou comest.<br> Low, like a nursing mother, will I bend me, and yield me as a maiden to her lover.<br> 11 Soon as the Bharatas have fared across thee, the warrior band, urged on and sped by Indra,<br> Then let your streams flow on in rapid motion. I crave your favour who deserve our worship.<br> 12 The warrior host, the Bharatas, fared over the singer won the favour of the Rivers.<br> Swell with your billows, hasting, pouring riches. Fill full your channels, and roll swiftly onward.<br> 13 So let your wave bear up the pins, and ye, O Waters, spare the thongs;<br> And never may the pair of Bulls, harmless and sinless, waste away.</p>
