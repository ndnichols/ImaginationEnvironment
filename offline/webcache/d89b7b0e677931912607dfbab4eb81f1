<p>1. FROM you two came the gifts in days aforetime which Trasadasyu granted to the P&#363;rus.<br> Ye gave the winner of our fields and plough-lands, and the strong smiter who subdued the Dasyus.<br> 2 And ye gave mighty Dadhikr&#257;s, the giver of many gifts, who visiteth all people,<br> Impetuous hawk, swift and of varied colour, like a brave King whom each true man must honour.<br> 3 Whom, as &#146;twere down a precipice, swift rushing, each P&#363;ru praises and his heart rejoices,&#151;<br> Springing forth like a hero fain for battle, whirling the car and flying like the tempest.<br> 4 Who gaineth precious booty in the combats and moveth, winning spoil, among the cattle;<br> Shown in bright colour, looking on the assemblies, beyond the churl, to worship of the living.<br> 5 Loudly the folk cry after him in battles, as &#146;twere a thief who steals away a garment;<br> Speeding to glory, or a herd of cattle, even as a hungry falcon swooping downward.<br> 6 And, fain to come forth first amid these armies, this way and that with rows of cars he rushes,<br> Gay like a bridesman, making him a garland, tossing the dust, champing the rein that holds him.<br> 7 And that strong Steed, victorious and faithful, obedient with his body in the combat,<br> Speeding straight on amid the swiftly pressing, casts o&#146;er his brows the dust he tosses upward.<br> 8 And at his thunder, like the roar of heaven, those who attack tremble and are affrighted;<br> For when he fights against embattled thousands, dread is he in his striving; none may stay him.<br> 9 The people praise the overpowering swiftness of this fleet Steed who giveth men abundance.<br> Of him they say when drawing back from battle. Dadhikr&#257;s hath sped forward with his thousands.<br> 10 Dadhikr&#257;s hath o&#146;erspread the Fivefold People with vigour, as the Sun lightens the waters.<br> May the strong Steed who winneth hundreds, thousands, requite with sweetness these my words and praises.</p>
