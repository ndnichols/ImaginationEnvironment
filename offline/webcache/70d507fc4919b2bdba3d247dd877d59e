<p>1. KING of trimmed grass, Herald within the dwelling, may Agni worship the Impeller's World-halves.<br> He, Son of Strength, the Holy, from a distance hath spread himself abroad with light like S&#363;rya.<br> 2 In thee, most wise, shall Dyaus, for full perfection, King! Holy One! pronounce the call to worship.<br> Found in three places, like the Speeder's footstep, come to present men's riches as oblations!<br> 3 Whose blaze most splendid, sovran in the forest, shines waxing on his way like the - Impeller.<br> He knows himself, like as a guileless smelter, not to be stayed among the plants, Immortal.<br> 4 Our friends extol him like a steed for vigour even Agni in the dwelling, jatave~as.<br> Trce-fed, he fights with power as doth a champion, like Dawn's Sire to be praised with sacrifices.<br> 5 Men wonder at his shining glows when, paring the woods with case, o&#146;er the broad earth he goeth,<br> And, like a rushing flood, loosed quickly, burneth, swift as a guilty thief, o&#146;er desert places.<br> 6 So mighty thou protectest us from slander, O Champion, Agni! with all fires enkindled.<br> Bring opulence and drive away affliction. May brave sons gladden us through a hundred winters.</p>
