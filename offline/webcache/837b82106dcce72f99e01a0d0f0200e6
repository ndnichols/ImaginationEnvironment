<TD><P>And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in YHVH, mine horn is    
exalted in YHVH: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in   
thy salvation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>
There is none holy as YHVH: for there is none beside thee: neither is there any 
rock like our ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of    
your mouth: for YHVH is a EL of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>The bows of the   
mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>They that were full    
have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that  
the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>YHVH killeth, and 
maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>YHVH maketh poor, and maketh    
rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and       
lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make 
them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are YHVH's, and  
he hath set the world upon them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>
9</H4></TD><TD><P>He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be  
silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>The adversaries of YHVH shall be  
broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: YHVH shall judge    
the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the  
horn of his anointed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister  
unto YHVH before Eli the priest.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12>   
<H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not   
YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice,  
the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of 
three teeth in his hand;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all   
that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in       
Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Also before they burnt the fat,   
the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to   
roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And if any man  
said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as    
much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give   
it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore the sin of the young men was very  
great before YHVH: for men abhorred the offering of YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>But Samuel ministered before      
YHVH, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover his mother made him a little coat,  
and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to   
offer the yearly sacrifice.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>    
20</H4></TD><TD><P>And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, YHVH give    
thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to YHVH. And they went unto  
their own home.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And YHVH visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two  
daughters. And the child Samuel grew before YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Now Eli was very old, and heard   
all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that     
assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, Why do 
ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Nay, my sons; for it 
is no good report that I hear: ye make YHVH's people to transgress.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>If one man sin       
against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against YHVH, who  
shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of     
their father, because YHVH would slay them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favor  
both with YHVH, and also with men.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27> 
<H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And there came a man of ELOHIYM unto Eli, and said unto  
him, Thus saith YHVH, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when   
they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And did I choose him out of all the tribes of   
Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an   
ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings  
made by fire of the children of Israel?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine   
offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honorest thy sons above  
me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my  
people?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>     
Wherefore YHVH ELOHIYM of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the   
house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now YHVH saith, Be it  
far from me; for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me      
shall be lightly esteemed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>     
31</H4></TD><TD><P>Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and    
the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine      
house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which shall give    
Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And the man of thine,     
whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and   
to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the     
flower of their age.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two    
sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will raise me  
up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart    
and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before     
mine anointed for ever.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine     
house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, 
and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I    
may eat a piece of bread.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright
