<p>1. SING boldly forth, &#346;y&#257;v&#257;&#347;va, with the Maruts who are loud in song,<br> Who, holy, as their wont is, joy in glory that is free from guile.<br> 2 For in their boldness they are friends of firm and sure heroic strength.<br> They in their course, bold-spirited, guard all men of their own accord.<br> 3 Like steers in rapid motion they advance and overtake the nights;<br> And thus the Maruts&#146; power in heaven and on the earth we celebrate.<br> 4 With boldness to your Maruts let us offer laud and sacrifice:<br> Who all, through ages of mankind, guard mortal man from injury.<br> 5 Praiseworthy, givers of good gifts, Heroes with full and perfect strength -<br> To Maruts, Holy Ones of heaven, will I extol the sacrifice.<br> 6 The lofty Heroes cast their spears and weapons bright with gleaming gold.<br> After these Maruts followed close, like laughing lightning from the sky, a splendour of its own accord.<br> 7 They who waxed mighty, of the earth, they who are in the wide mid-air,<br> Or in the rivers&#146; compass, or in the abode of ample heaven.<br> 8 Praise thou the Maruts&#146; company, the valorous and truly strong,<br> The Heroes, hasting, by themselves have yoked their deer for victory.<br> 9 Fair-gleaming, on Paru&#7779;&#7751;&#299; they have clothed themselves in robes of wool,<br> And with their chariot tires they cleave the rock asunder in their might.<br> 10 Whether as wanderers from the way or speeders on or to the path,<br> Under these names the spreading band tend well the sacrifice for me.<br> 11 To this the Heroes well attend, well do their teams attend to this.<br> Visible are their varied forms. Behold, they are Paravatas.<br> 12 Hymn-singing, seeking water, they, praising, have danced about the spring.<br> What are they unto me? No thieves, but helpers, splendid to behold.<br> 13 Sublime, with lightnings for their spears, Sages and Orderers are they.<br> &#7770;&#7779;i, adore that Marut host, and make them happy with thy song.<br> 14 &#7770;&#7779;i, invite the Marut band with offerings, as a maid her friend.<br> From heaven, too, Bold Ones, in your might haste hither glorified with songs.<br> 15 Thinking of these now let him come, as with the escort of the Gods,<br> And with the splendid Princes, famed for rapid courses, to the gifts.<br> 16 Princes, who, when I asked their kin, named P&#7771;&#347;ni as their Mother-cow,<br> And the impetuous Rudra they, the Mighty Ones, declared their Sire.<br> 17 The mighty ones, the seven times seven, have singly given me hundred gifts.<br> I have obtained on Yamuna famed wealth in kine and wealth in steeds.</p>
