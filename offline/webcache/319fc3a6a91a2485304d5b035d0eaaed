<TD><P>Then Pilate therefore took YAHSHUA, and scourged him.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And the soldiers platted a      
crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And said, Hail,   
King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Pilate therefore went forth again,  
and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I  
find no fault in him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Then came YAHSHUA forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple     
robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>When the chief priests therefore    
and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate  
saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>The Jews answered 
him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the 
Son of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And went again into    
the judgment hall, and saith unto YAHSHUA, Whence art thou? But YAHSHUA gave    
him no answer.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that 
I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA answered, Thou        
couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: 
therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And from thenceforth Pilate   
sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, 
thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against  
Caesar.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>When 
Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought YAHSHUA forth, and sat down in   
the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew,    
Gabbatha.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he    
saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>But they cried out, Away with him, away with    
him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief  
priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Then delivered he him therefore unto them to 
be crucified. And they took YAHSHUA, and led him away.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And he bearing his cross went     
forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew   
Golgotha:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and       
YAHSHUA in the midst.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing  
was YAHSHUA OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>This title then read many of the Jews: for   
the place where YAHSHUA was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written  
in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21>   
<H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write 
not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Pilate answered,     
What I have written I have written.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23>
<H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the soldiers, when they had crucified YAHSHUA, took 
his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat:  
now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>They said therefore among     
themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that   
the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among     
them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the         
soldiers did.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Now there stood by the cross of YAHSHUA his mother, and his mother's sister, 
Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>When YAHSHUA therefore saw his mother, and   
the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman,       
behold thy son!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD>
<P>Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that    
disciple took her unto his own home.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>After this, YAHSHUA knowing that all things     
were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I          
thirst.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Now  
there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar,  
and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>When YAHSHUA therefore had        
received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave  
up the ghost.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should   
not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high 
day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be   
taken away.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which 
was crucified with him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>But when they came to YAHSHUA, and saw that he was dead already,    
they brake not his legs:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4>
</TD><TD><P>But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and          
forthwith came there out blood and water.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And he that saw it bare record, and his record  
is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>For these things were     
done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be        
broken.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>And after this  
Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of YAHSHUA, but secretly for fear of the 
Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of YAHSHUA: and Pilate   
gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of YAHSHUA.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>And there came also       
Nicodemus, which at the first came to YAHSHUA by night, and brought a mixture   
of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>Then took they the body of        
YAHSHUA, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the    
Jews is to bury.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the   
garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>There laid they YAHSHUA therefore 
because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.</P>
