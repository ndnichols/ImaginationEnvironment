<p>1. THY raptures ever were for all men's profit: so evermore have been thine earthly riches.<br> Thou still hast been the dealer-forth of vigour, since among Gods thou hast had power and Godhead.<br> 2 Men have obtained his strength by sacrificing, and ever urged him, on to hero valour.<br> For the rein-seizing, the impetuous Charger they furnished power even for V&#7771;tra's slaughter.<br> 3 Associate with him, as teams of horses, help, manly might, and vigour follow Indra.<br> As rivers reach the sea, so, strong with praises, our holy songs reach him the Comprehensive.<br> 4 Lauded by us, let flow the spring, O Indra, of excellent and brightly-shining riches.<br> For thou art Lord of men, without an equal: of all the world thou art the only Sovran.<br> 5 Hear what thou mayst hear, thou who, fain for worship, as heaven girds earth, guardest thy servant's treasure;<br> Tlat thou mayst be our own, joying in power, famed through thy might in every generation.</p>
