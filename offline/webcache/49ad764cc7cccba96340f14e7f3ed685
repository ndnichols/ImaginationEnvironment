<p>1. SPREAD is thy cleansing filter, Brahma&#7751;aspati: as Prince, thou enterest its limbs from every side.<br> The raw, whose mass hath not been heated gains not this: they only which are dressed, which bear, attain to it.<br> 2 High in the seat of heaven is spread the Scorcher's sieve: its threads are standing separate, glittering with light.<br> The Swift Ones favour him who purifieth this: with consciousness they stand upon the height of heaven.<br> 3 The foremost spotted Steer hath made the Mornings shine, and yearning after strength sustains all things that be.<br> By his high wisdom have the mighty Sages wrought: the Fathers who behold mankind laid down the germ,<br> 4 Gandharva verily protects his dwellingplace; Wondrous, he guards the generations of the Gods.<br> Lord of the snare, he takes the foeman with the snare: those who are most devout have gained a share of meath.<br> 5 Rich in oblations! robed in cloud, thou corapassest oblation, sacrifice, the mighty seat of Gods.<br> King, on thy chariot-sieve thou goest up to war, and with a thousand weapons winnest lofty fame.</p>
