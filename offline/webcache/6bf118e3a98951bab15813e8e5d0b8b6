<TD><P>And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of    
James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint     
him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And very  
early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at 
the rising of the sun.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone    
from the door of the sepulchre?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4> 
4</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled      
away: for it was very great.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>    
5</H4></TD><TD><P>And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting 
on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were               
affrighted.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek YAHSHUA of Nazareth, which   
was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid    
him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>But go    
your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee:   
there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And they went out quickly, and fled from the      
sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to    
any man; for they were afraid.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>  
9</H4></TD><TD><P>Now when YAHSHUA was risen early the first day of the week,   
he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And she went    
and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And they, when they had   
heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>After that he appeared in 
another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And they went   
and told it unto the residue: neither believed they them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Afterward he appeared unto the    
eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness 
of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was        
risen.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every     
creature.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>He 
that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall  
be damned.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out  
devils; they shall speak with new tongues;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>They shall take up serpents; and if they drink  
any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and 
they shall recover.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD>
<TD><P>So then after the ADONAY had spoken unto them, he was received up into   
heaven, and sat on the right hand of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And they went forth, and preached every      
where, the ADONAY working with them, and confirming the word with signs         
following. Amen.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by
