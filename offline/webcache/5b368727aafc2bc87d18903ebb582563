<p>1. THAT Brahman pleases Indra well, who worships, sacrifices, pours Libation, and prepares the meal.<br> 2 &#346;akra protects from woe the man who gives him sacrificial cake.<br> And offers Soma blent with milk.<br> 3 His chariot shall be glorious, sped by Gods, and mighty shall he be,<br> Subduing all hostilities.<br> 4 Each day that passes, in his house flows his libation, rich in milk,<br> Exhaustless, bringing progeny.<br> 5 O Gods, with constant draught of milk, husband and wife with one accord<br> Press out and wash the Soma juice.<br> 6 They gain sufficient food: they come united to the sacred grass,<br> And never do they fail in strength.<br> 7 Never do they deny or seek to hide the favour of the Gods:<br> They win high glory for themselves.<br> 8 With sons and daughters by their side they reach their full extent of life,<br> Both decked with ornaments of gold.<br> 9 Serving the Immortal One with gifts of sacrificial meal and wealth,<br> They satisfy the claims of love and pay due honour to the Gods.<br> 10 We claim protection from the Hills, we claim protection of the Floods,<br> Of him who stands by Vi&#7779;&#7751;u's side.<br> 11 May P&#363;&#7779;an come, and Bhaga, Lord of wealth, All-bounteous, for our weal<br> Broad be the path that leads to bliss:<br> 12 Aramati, and, free from foes, Visva with spirit of a God,<br> And the &#256;dityas&#146; peerless might.<br> 13 Seeing that Mitra, Aryaman, and Varu&#7751;a are guarding us,<br> The paths of Law are fair to tread.<br> 14 I glorify with song, for wealth, Agni the God, the first of you.<br> We honour as a well-loved Friend the God who prospereth our fields.<br> 15 As in all frays the hero, so swift moves his car whom Gods attend.<br> The man who, sacrificing, strives to win the heart of Deities will conquer those who worship not.<br> 16 Ne&#146;er are ye injured, worshipper, presser of juice, or pious man.<br> The man who, sacrificing, strives to win the heart of Deities will conquer those who worship not.<br> 17 None in his action equals him, none holds him far or keeps him off.<br> The man who, sacrificing, strives to win the heart of Deities will conquer those who worship not.<br> 18 Such strength of heroes shall be his, such mastery of fleet-foot steeds.<br> The man who, sacrificing, strives to win the heart of Deities will conquer those who worship not.</p>
