1</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art     
that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for    
thou that judgest doest the same things.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>But we are sure that the judgment of ELOHIYM is   
according to truth against them which commit such things.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And thinkest thou this, O man, that 
judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape   
the judgment of ELOHIYM?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and    
longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of ELOHIYM leadeth thee to         
repentance?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>   
But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath    
against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of            
ELOHIYM;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Who   
will render to every man according to his deeds:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>To them who by patient continuance  
in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>But unto them that are 
contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation   
and wrath,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew     
first, and also of the Gentile;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>
10</H4></TD><TD><P>But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh      
good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>For there is no respect of        
persons with ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without    
law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>(For not the hearers 
of the law are just before ELOHIYM, but the doers of the law shall be           
justified.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>  
For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things          
contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Which shew the  
work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, 
and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>In the day when 
ELOHIYM shall judge the secrets of men by YAHSHUA MASHIYACH according to my     
gospel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>     
Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of  
ELOHIYM,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being       
instructed out of the law;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>     
19</H4></TD><TD><P>And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the       
blind, a light of them which are in darkness,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of   
babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou therefore which 
teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should   
not steal, dost thou steal?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>    
22</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou 
commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou that makest thy 
boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou ELOHIYM?</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>For the name of YHVH 
is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>For circumcision verily   
profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy       
circumcision is made uncircumcision.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the        
righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for           
circumcision?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge 
thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>For he is not a Jew,      
which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the   
flesh:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>But   
he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in   
the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of           
ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M.
