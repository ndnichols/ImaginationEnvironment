But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And kept back     
part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, 
and laid it at the apostles' feet.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3>  
<H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine      
heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the       
land?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Whiles   
it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine   
own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not     
lied unto men, but unto ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>
5</H4></TD><TD><P>And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the    
ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And the young men arose,    
wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And it was about the space of three 
hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And Peter answered unto     
her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so    
much.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Then     
Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit 
of YHVH? behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the      
door, and shall carry thee out.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>
10</H4></TD><TD><P>Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up   
the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her     
forth, buried her by her husband.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11>  
<H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as     
many as heard these things.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>    
12</H4></TD><TD><P>And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders 
wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's       
porch.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified         
them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
believers were the more added to YHVH, multitudes both of men and women.)</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Insomuch that   
they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and         
couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some 
of them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>    
There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem,       
bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they   
were healed every one.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him,      
(which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And laid their hands 
on the apostles, and put them in the common prison.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>But the angel of YHVH by night    
opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Go, stand and speak in the temple 
to the people all the words of this life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they heard that, they entered into the 
temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they     
that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the  
children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>But when the officers     
came, and found them not in the prison, they returned and told,</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Saying, The prison truly  
found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the      
doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Now when the high priest and the  
captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of 
them whereunto this would grow.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>
25</H4></TD><TD><P>Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye 
put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>Then went the captain     
with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the       
people, lest they should have been stoned.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they had brought them, they set them   
before the council: and the high priest asked them,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Saying, Did not we straitly       
command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled  
Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Peter and  
the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey ELOHIYM rather than      
men.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>The     
ELOHIYM of our fathers raised up YAHSHUA, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>Him hath        
ELOHIYM exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give   
repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And we are his witnesses of these things;    
and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom ELOHIYM hath given to them that obey        
him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>When    
they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>Then stood      
there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law,   
had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth 
a little space;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend 
to do as touching these men.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>   
36</H4></TD><TD><P>For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to   
be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves:    
who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to   
nought.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>     
After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew     
away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed   
him, were dispersed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: 
for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought:</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>But if it be of      
ELOHIYM, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against   
EL.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>And to   
him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they   
commanded that they should not speak in the name of YAHSHUA, and let them       
go.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>And they 
departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted     
worthy to suffer shame for his name.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>And daily in the temple, and in every house,    
they ceased not to teach and preach YAHSHUA MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
