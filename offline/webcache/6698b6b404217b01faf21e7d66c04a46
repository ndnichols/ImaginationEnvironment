<TD><P>And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the          
bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And he laid hold on the dragon, that old       
serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And cast him into the  
bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should        
deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and   
after that he must be loosed a little season.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and 
judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded    
for the witness of YAHSHUA, and for the word of ELOHIYM, and which had not      
worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon     
their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with MASHIYACH a 
thousand years.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were       
finished. This is the first resurrection.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the      
first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be   
priests of ELOHIYM and of MASHIYACH, and shall reign with him a thousand        
years.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And     
when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his           
prison,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the       
earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is 
as the sand of the sea.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the     
camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from ELOHIYM 
out of heaven, and devoured them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10>  
<H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake  
of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be  
tormented day and night for ever and ever.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And I saw a great white throne, and him that    
sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was    
found no place for them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before ELOHIYM; and the  
books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and  
the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books,       
according to their works.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>      
13</H4></TD><TD><P>And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and 
hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man   
according to their works.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>      
14</H4></TD><TD><P>And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is  
the second death.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into    
the lake of fire.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by
