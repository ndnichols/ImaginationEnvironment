<p>1. WHEN, even as she were present here, red Dawn hath shone from far away,<br> She spreadeth light on every side.<br> 2 Like Heroes on your will-yoked car farshining, Wonder-Workers! ye<br> Attend, O A&#347;vins, on the Dawn.<br> 3 By you, O Lords of ample wealth our songs of praise have been observed:<br> As envoy have I brought the prayer.<br> 4 Ka&#7751;vas must praise the A&#347;vins dear to many, making many glad,<br> Most rich, that they may succour us.<br> 5 Most liberal, best at winning strength, inciters, Lords of splendour who<br> Visit the worshipper's abode.<br> 6 So for devout Sudeva dew with fatness his unfailing mead,<br> And make it rich for sacrifice.<br> 7 Hitherward running speedily with horses, as with rapid hawks,<br> Come, A&#347;vins, to our song of praise<br> 8 Wherewith the three wide distances, and all the lights that are in heaven.<br> Ye traverse, and three times of night.<br> 9 O Finders of the Day, that we may win us food of kine and wealth,<br> Open the paths for us to tread.<br> 10 O A&#347;vins, bring us wealth in kine, in noble heroes, and in cars:<br> Bring us the strength that horses give.<br> 11 Ye Lords of splendour, glorified, ye Wonder-Workers borne on paths<br> Of gold, drink sweets with Somajuice.<br> 12 To us, ye Lords of ample wealth, and to our wealth chiefs extend<br> Wide shelter, ne&#146;er to be assailed.<br> 13 Come quickly downward to the prayer of people whom ye favour most:<br> Approach not unto other folk.<br> 14 Ye A&#347;vins whom our minds perceive, drink of this lovely gladdening draught,<br> The mcath which we present to you.<br> 15 Bring riches hither unto us in hundreds and in thousands, source<br> Of plenteous food, sustaining all.<br> 16 Verily sages call on you, ye Heroes, in full many a place.<br> Moved by the priests, O A&#347;vins, conic.<br> 17 Men who have trimmed the sacred grass, bringing oblations and prepared,<br> O A&#347;vins, are invoking you.<br> 18 May this our hymn of praise to-day, most powerful to bring you, be,<br> O A&#347;vins, nearest to your hearts.<br> 19 The skin filled full of savoury meath, laid in the pathway of your car-<br> O A&#347;vins, drink ye both therefrom.<br> 20 For this, ye Lords of ample wealth, bring blessing for our herd, our kine,<br> Our progeny, and plenteous food.<br> 21 Ye too unclose to us like doors the strengthening waters of the sky,<br> And rivers, ye who find the day.<br> 22 When did the son of Tugra serve you, Men? Abandoned in the sea,<br> That with winged steeds your car might fly.<br> 23 Ye, O N&#257;satyas, ministered to Ka&#7751;va with repeated aid,<br> When cast into the heated pit.<br> 24 Come near with those most recent aids of yours which merit eulogy,<br> When I invoke you, Wealthy Gods.<br> 25 As ye protected Ka&#7751;va erst, Priyamedha and Upastuta,<br> Atri, Sinjara, A&#347;vins Twain<br> 26 And Amsu in decisive fight, Agastya in the fray for kine.<br> And, in his battles, Sobhari.<br> 27 For so much bliss, or even more, O A&#347;vins, Wealthy Gods, than this,<br> We pray white singing hymns to you.<br> 28 Ascend your car with golden seat, O A&#347;vins, and with reins of gold,<br> That reaches even to the sky.<br> 29 Golden is its supporting shaft, the axle also is of gold,<br> And both the wheels are made of gold.<br> 30 Thereon, ye Lords of ample wealth, come to us even from afar,<br> Come ye to this mine eulogy.<br> 31 From far away ye come to us, A&#347;vins, enjoying plenteous food<br> Of D&#257;sas, O Immortal Ones.<br> 32 With splendour, riches, and renown, O A&#347;vins, hither come to us,<br> N&#257;satyas, shining brilliantly.<br> 33 May dappled horses, steeds who fly with pinions, bring you hitherward<br> To people skilled in sacrifice.<br> 34 The whcel delayeth not that car of yours accompanied by song,<br> That cometh with a store of food.<br> 35 Borne on that chariot wrought of gold, with coursers very fleet of foot,<br> Come, O N&#257;satyas, swift as thought.<br> 36 O Wealthy Gods, ye taste and find the brisk and watchful wild beast good.<br> Associate wealth with food for us.<br> 37 As such, O A&#347;vins, find for me my share of new-presented gifts,<br> As Kasu, Cedi's son, gave me a hundred head of buffaloes, and ten thousand kine.<br> 38 He who hath given me for mine own ten Kings like gold to look upon.<br> At Caidya's feet are all the people round about, all those who think upon the shield.<br> 39 No man, not any, goes upon the path on which the Cedis walk.<br> No other prince, no folk is held more liberal of gifts than they.</p>
