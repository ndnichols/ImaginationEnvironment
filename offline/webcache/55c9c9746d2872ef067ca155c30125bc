<TD><P>And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation     
with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound YAHSHUA, and       
carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the 
Jews? And he answering said unto them, Thou sayest it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And the chief priests accused him   
of many things: but he answered nothing.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>But YAHSHUA yet answered    
nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6>  
<H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner,     
whomsoever they desired.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that    
had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the                 
insurrection.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done    
unto them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>But 
Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the   
Jews?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>For he 
knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>But the chief priests moved the   
people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And Pilate answered and said      
again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the    
King of the Jews?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And they cried out again, Crucify him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil   
hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And so Pilate,       
willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered       
YAHSHUA, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And the soldiers led him away     
into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And they        
clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his    
head,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And they smote him on the head with a reed, and 
did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they had mocked him,     
they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him  
out to crucify him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the   
country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And they bring him unto the   
place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And they gave him to      
drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they had crucified him,  
they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should         
take.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And it 
was the third hour, and they crucified him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27>
<H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his

their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it   
in three days,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>Save thyself, and come down from the cross.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>Likewise also the chief priests mocking said

</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>Let MASHIYACH

<A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the sixth hour was come, there was  
darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>And at the ninth hour YAHSHUA     
cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being  
interpreted, My EL, my EL, why hast thou forsaken me?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And some of them that stood by,

alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA cried with a loud 
voice, and gave up the ghost.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>
