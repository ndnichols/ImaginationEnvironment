<p>1. SING like the two press-stones for this same purpose; come like two misers to the tree of treasure;<br> Like two laud-singing Brahmans in the assembly, like the folk's envoys called in many places.<br> 2 Moving at morning like two car-borne heroes, like to a pair of goats ye come electing;<br> Like two fair dames embellishing their bodies, like a wise married pair among the people.<br> 3 Like to a pair of horns come first to us-ward, like to a pair of hoofs with rapid motion;<br> Come like two Cakav&#257;s in the grey of morning, come like two chariot wheels at dawn, ye Mighty.<br> 4 Bear us across the rivers like two vessels, save us as ye were yokes, naves, spokes and fellies.<br> Be like two dogs that injure not our bodies; preserve us, like two crutches, that we fall not.<br> 5 Like two winds ageing not, two confluent rivers, come with quick vision like two eyes before us.<br> Come like two hands most helpful to the body, and guide us like two feet to what is precious.<br> 6 Even as two lips that with the mouth speak honey, even as two breasts that nourish our existence,<br> Like the two nostrils that protect our being, be to us as our ears that hear distinctly.<br> 7 Like two hands give ye us increasing vigour; like heaven and earth constrain the airy regions.<br> A&#347;vins, these hymns that struggle to approach you, sharpen ye like an axe upon a whetstone.<br> 8 These prayers of ours exalting you, O A&#347;vins, have the G&#7771;tsamadas, for a laud, made ready.<br> Welcome them, O ye Heroes, and come hither. Loud may we speak. with brave men, in assembly.</p>
