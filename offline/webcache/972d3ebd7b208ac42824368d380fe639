<p>1. LET the prayer issue from the seat of Order, for S&#363;rya with his beams hath loosed the cattle.<br> With lofty ridges earth is far extended, and Agni's flame hath lit the spacious surface.<br> 2 O Asuras, O Varu&#7751;a and Mitra, this hymn to you, like food, anew I offer.<br> One of you is a strong unerring Leader, and Mitra, speaking, stirreth men to labour.<br> 3 The movements of the gliding wind come hither: like cows, the springs are filled to overflowing.<br> Born in the station e&#146;en of lofty heaven the Bull hath loudly bellowed in this region.<br> 4 May I bring hither with my song, O Indra, wise Aryaman who yokes thy dear Bay Horses,<br> Voracious, with thy noble car, O Hero, him who defeats the wrath of the malicious.<br> 5 In their own place of sacrifice adorers worship to gain long life and win his friendship.<br> He hath poured food on men when they have praised him; be this, the dearest reverence, paid to Rudra.<br> 6 Coming together, glorious, loudly roaring - Sarasvat&#299;, Mother of Floods, the seventh-<br> With copious milk, with fair streams, strongly flowing, full swelling with the volume of their water;<br> 7. And may the mighty Maruts, too, rejoicing, aid our devotion and protect our offspring.<br> Let not swift-moving Aksara neglect us: they have increased our own appropriate riches,<br> 8 Bring ye the great Aramati before you, and P&#363;&#7779;an as the Hero of the synod,<br> Bhaga who looks upon this hymn with favour, and, as our strength, the bountiful Purandbi.<br> 9 May this our song of praise reach you, O Maruts, and Vi&#7779;&#7751;u guardian of the future infant.<br> May they vouchsafe the singer strength for offspring. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
