<p>1. MAY your gold chariot, drawn by vigorous horses, come to us, blocking up the earth<br> and heaven,<br> Bright with its fellies while its way drops fatness, food-laden, rich in coursers, man's protector.<br> 2 Let it approach, yoked by thewill, three-seated, extending far and wide o&#146;er fivefold beings,<br> Whereon ye visit God-adoring races, bending your course whither ye will, O A&#347;vins.<br> 3 Renowned, with noble horses, come ye hither: drink, Wondrous Pair, the cup that holds sweet juices.<br> Your car whereon your Spouse is wont to travel marks with its track the farthest ends of heaven.<br> 4 When night was turning to the grey of morning the Maiden, S&#363;rya's Daughter, chose your splendour.<br> When with your power and might ye aid the pious he comes through heat to life by your assistance.<br> 5 O Chariot-borne, this car of yours invested with rays of light comes harnessed to our dwelling.<br> Herewith, O A&#347;vins, while the dawn is breaking, to this our sacrifice bring peace and blessing.<br> 6 Like the wild cattle thirsty for the lightning, Heroes, come nigh this day to our libations.<br> Men call on you with hymns in many places, but let not other worshippers detain you.<br> 7 Bhujyu, abandoned in the midst of ocean, ye raised from out the water with your horses,<br> Uninjured, winged, flagging not, undaunted, with deeds of wonder saving him, O A&#347;vins.<br> 8 Now hear, O Youthful Twain, mine invocation: come, A&#347;vins, to the home where food aboundeth.<br> Vouchsafe us wealth, do honour to our nobles. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
