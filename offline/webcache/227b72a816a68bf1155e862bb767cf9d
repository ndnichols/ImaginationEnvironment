against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And say unto the Ammonites, Hear    
the word of the ADONAY YHVH; Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH; Because thou saidst,   
Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of        
Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went    
into captivity;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a           
possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee, and make their dwellings  
in thee: they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk.</P></TD></TR>

stable for camels, and the Ammonites a couching place for flocks: and ye shall

the land of Israel;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Behold, therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and will       
deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee off from the       
people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy    
thee; and thou shalt know that I am YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore thus saith the ADONAY

fall by the sword.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD>
