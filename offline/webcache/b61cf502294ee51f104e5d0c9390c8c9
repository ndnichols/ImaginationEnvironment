NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father    
was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being 
seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was   
with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and   
Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Now Israel loved Joseph more than   
all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat 
of many colors.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his      
brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And Joseph dreamed a dream, 
and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, Hear, I  
pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the       
field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your       
sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And his brethren said to him, Shalt 
thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they 
hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And he dreamed yet another dream,   
and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and,   
behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And he told it to    
his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, 
What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy       
brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And his brethren envied   
him; but his father observed the saying.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And his brethren went to feed their father's    
flock in Shechem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in       
Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am      
I.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And he    
said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and     
well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale   
of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15> 
<H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was         
wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, I  
seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And the man said,    
They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph  
went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they saw him afar off,   
even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And they said   
one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and    
cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and 
we shall see what will become of his dreams.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out   
of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood,    
but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; 
that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father          
again.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stripped     
Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colors that was on him;</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And they took him, and    
cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And they sat down to 
eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of  
Ishmaelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and     
myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit   
is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>Come, and let us sell him to the  
Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our    
flesh. And his brethren were content.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen;    
and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the       
Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And Reuben      
returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his  
clothes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall 
I go?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in  
the blood;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father; and 
said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's coat or no.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And he knew it, and  
said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without   
doubt rent in pieces.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and   
mourned for his son many days.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4> 
35</H4></TD><TD><P>And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort    
him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the   
grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>And the Midianites sold him into  
Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.</P></TD>
