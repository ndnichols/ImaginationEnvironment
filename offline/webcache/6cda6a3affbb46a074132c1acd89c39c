And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said,      
Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>When therefore Paul    
and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined 
that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem    
unto the apostles and elders about this question.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And being brought on their way by   
the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion   
of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they were come to  
Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders,    
and they declared all things that ELOHIYM had done with them.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>But there rose up certain of    
the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to        
circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And the apostles and elders     
came together for to consider of this matter.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And when there had been much disputing, Peter  
rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while    
ago ELOHIYM made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the 
word of the gospel, and believe.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>
8</H4></TD><TD><P>And ELOHIYM, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness,     
giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And put no difference between us    
and them, purifying their hearts by faith.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Now therefore why tempt ye ELOHIYM, to put a    
yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able 
to bear?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>But 
we believe that through the grace of the ADONAY YAHSHUA MASHIYACH we shall be   
saved, even as they.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas  
and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders ELOHIYM had wrought among the     
Gentiles by them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and     
brethren, hearken unto me:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>     
14</H4></TD><TD><P>Simeon hath declared how ELOHIYM at the first did visit the  
Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And to this agree the words of    
the prophets; as it is written,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>
16</H4></TD><TD><P>After this I will return, and will build again the           
tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins     
thereof, and I will set it up:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4> 
17</H4></TD><TD><P>That the residue of men might seek after YHVH, and all the   
Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith YHVH, who doeth all these          
things.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>     
Known unto ELOHIYM are all his works from the beginning of the world.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore my         
sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned 
to ELOHIYM:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P> 
But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and    
from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>For Moses of old time hath in 
every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath     
day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Then    
pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of 
their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed     
Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brethren:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And they wrote letters by them    
after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the  
brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Forasmuch as we have 
heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words,        
subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to     
whom we gave no such commandment:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25>  
<H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, 
to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>Men that have hazarded    
their lives for the name of our ADONAY YAHSHUA MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>We have sent therefore Judas and  
Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>For it seemed good to the Holy    
Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary        
things;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>That 
ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things         
strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do  
well. Fare ye well.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD>
<TD><P>So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had     
gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>Which when they had read,     
they rejoiced for the consolation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32> 
<H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves,     
exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And after they had tarried there  
a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>Notwithstanding it   
pleased Silas to abide there still.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35>
<H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching    
and preaching the word of YHVH, with many others also.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>And some days after Paul said     
unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we    
have preached the word of YHVH, and see how they do.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And Barnabas determined to take   
with them John, whose surname was Mark.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>But Paul thought not good to take him with      
them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the      
work.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from   
the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>And Paul chose Silas, and     
departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of ELOHIYM.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>And he went through  
Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This
