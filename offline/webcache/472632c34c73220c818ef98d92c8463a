<p>1. ON that most wondrous car of yours, O Indra and Agni, which looks round on all things living,<br> Take ye your stand and come to us together, and drink libations of the flowing Soma.<br> 2 As vast as all this world is in its compass, deep as it is, with its far-stretching surface,<br> So let this Soma be, Indra and Agni, made for your drinking till your soul be sated.<br> 3 For ye have won a blessed name together: yea, with one aim ye strove, O V&#7771;tra-slayers.<br> So Indra-Agni, seated here together, pour in, ye Mighty Ones, the mighty Soma.<br> 4 Both stand adorned, when fires are duly kindled, spreading the sacred grass, with lifted ladles.<br> Drawn by strong Soma juice poured forth around us, come, Indra-Agni, and display your favour.<br> 5 The brave deeds ye have done, Indra and Agni, the forms ye have displayed and mighty exploits,<br> The ancient and auspicious bonds of friendship,&#151;for sake of these drink of the flowing Soma.<br> 6 As first I said when choosing you, in battle we must contend with Asuras for this Soma.<br> So came ye unto this my true conviction, and drank libations of the flowing Soma.<br> 7 If in your dwelling, or with prince or Brahman, ye, Indra-Agni, Holy Ones, rejoice you,<br> Even from thence, ye mighty Lords, come hither, and drink libation of the flowing Soma.<br> 8 If with, the Yadus, Turva&#347;as, ye sojourn, with Druhyus, Anus, P&#363;rus, Indra-Agni!<br> Even from thence, ye mighty Lords, come hither, and drink libations of the flowing Soma.<br> 9 Whether, O Indra-Agni, ye be dwelling in lowest earth, in central, or in highest.<br> Even from thence, ye mighty Lords, come hither, and drink libations of the flowing Soma.<br> 10 Whether, O Indra-Agni, ye be dwelling in highest earth, in central, or in lowest,<br> Even from thence, ye mighty Lords, come hither, and drink libations of the flowing Soma.<br> 11 Whether ye be in heaven, O Indra-Agni, on earth, on mountains, in the herbs, or waters,<br> Even from thence, ye mighty Lords, come hither, and drink libations of the flowing Soma.<br> 12 If, when the Sun to the mid-heaven hath mounted, ye take delight in food, O Indra-Agni,<br> Even from thence, ye mighty Lords, come hither, and drink libations of the flowing Soma.<br> 13 Thus having drunk your fill of our libation, win us all kinds of wealth, Indra and Agni.<br> This prayer of ours may Varu&#7751;a grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu, Earth and Heaven.</p>
