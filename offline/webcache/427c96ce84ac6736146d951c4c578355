<p>1. ROUSE ye for him who keeps the Law, yoke your steeds, A&#347;vins, to your car<br> Let your protecting help be near.<br> 2 Come, A&#347;vins, with your car more swift than is the twinkling of an eye<br> Let your protecting help be near.<br> 3 A&#347;vins, ye overlaid with cold the fiery pit for Atri's sake:<br> Let your protecting help be near.<br> 4 Where are ye? whither are ye gone? whither, like falcons, have ye flown?<br> Let your protecting help be near.<br> 5 If ye at any time this day are listening to this my call,<br> Let your protecting help be near.<br> 6 The A&#347;vins, first to hear our prayer, for closest kinship I approach:<br> Let your protecting help be near.<br> 7 For Atri ye, O A&#347;vins, made a dwelling-place to shield him well,<br> Let your protecting help be near.<br> 8 Ye warded off the fervent heat for Atri when he sweetly spake:<br> Let your protecting help be near.<br> 9 Erst Saptavadhri by his prayer obtained the trenchant edge of fire:<br> Let your protecting help be near.<br> 10 Come hither, O ye Lords of wealth, and listen to this call of mine:<br> Let your protecting help be near.<br> 11 What is this praise told forth of you as Elders in the ancient way?<br> Let your protecting help be near.<br> 12 One common brotherhood is yours, A&#347;vins your kindred is the same:<br> Let your protecting help be near.<br> 13 This is your chariot, A&#347;vins, which speeds through the regions, earth and heaven<br> Let your protecting aid be near.<br> 14 Approach ye hitherward to us with thousands both of steeds and kine:<br> Let your protecting help be near.<br> 15 Pass us not by, remember us with thousands both of kine <A HREF="errata.htm#25">and</A> steeds:<br> Let your protecting help be near.<br> 16 The purple-tinted Dawn hath risen, and true to Law hath made the light<br> Let your protecting help be near.<br> 17 He looked upon the A&#347;vins, as an axe-armed man upon a tree:<br> Let your protecting help be near.<br> 18 By the black band encompassed round, break it down, bold one, like a fort.<br> Let your protecting help be near.</p>
