<p>1. O THOU who slewest V&#7771;tra, come, O Indra, hither to our side,<br> Mighty One with thy mighty aids.<br> 2 Swift and impetuous art thou, wondrous amid the well-dressed folk:<br> Thou doest marvels for our help.<br> 3 Even with the weak thou smitest down him<br> who is stronger, with thy strength<br> The mighty, with the Friends thou hast.<br> 4 O Indra, we are close to thee; to thee we sing aloud our songs:<br> Help and defend us, even us.<br> 5 As such, O Caster of the Stone, come with thy succours wonderful,<br> Blameless, and irresistible.<br> 6 May we be friends of one like thee, O Indra, with the wealth of kine,<br> Comrades for lively energy.<br> 7 For thou, O Indra, art alone the Lord of strength that comes from kine<br> So grant thou us abundant food.<br> 8 They turn thee not another way, when, lauded, Lover of the Song,<br> Thou wilt give wealth to those who praise.<br> 9 The Gotamas have sung their song of praise to thee that thou mayst give,<br> Indra, for lively energy.<br> 10 We will declare thy hero deeds, what D&#257;sa forts thou brakest down,<br> Attacking them in rapturous joy.<br> 11 The sages sing those manly deeds which, Indra, Lover of the Song,<br> Thou wroughtest when the Soma flowed.<br> 12 Indra, the Gotamas who bring thee praises have grown strong by thee.<br> Give them renown with hero sons.<br> 13 For, Indra, verily thou art the general treasure even of all .<br> Thee, therefore, do we invocate.<br> 14 Excellent Indra, turn to us: glad thee among us with the juice<br> Of Somas, Soma-drinker thou.<br> 15 May praise from us who think Qn thee, O Indra, bring thee near to us.<br> Turn thy two Bay Steeds hitherward.<br> 16 Eat of our sacrificial cake: rejoice thee in the songs we sing.<br> Even as a lover in his bride.<br> 17 To India for a thousand steeds well-trained and fleet of foot we pray,<br> And hundred jars of Soma juice.<br> 18 We make a hundred of thy kine, yea, and a thousand, hasten nigh:<br> So let thy bounty come to us.<br> 19 We have obtained, a gift from thee, ten water-ewers wrought of gold:<br> Thou, V&#7771;tra-slayer, givest much.<br> 20 A bounteous Giver, give us much, bring much and not a trifling gift:<br> Much, Indra, wilt thou fain bestow.<br> 21 O V&#7771;tra-slayer, thou art famed in many a place as bountiful<br> Hero, thy bounty let us share.<br> 22 I praise thy pair of Tawny Steeds, wise Son of him who giveth kine<br> Terrify not the cows with these.<br> 23 Like two slight images of girls, unrobed, upon a new-wrought post,<br> So shine the Bay Steeds in their course.<br> 24 For me the Bays are ready when I start, or start not, with the dawn, Innocuous in the ways they take.</p>
