Chapter 25</H1></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and      
lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went   
down to the wilderness of Paran.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>
2</H4></TD><TD><P>And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in        
Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a      
thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Now the name of the man was Nabal;  
and the name of his wife Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding,    
and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his        
doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did  
shear his sheep.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you 
up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And thus shall ye say to him that   
liveth in prosperity, Peace be both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and   
peace be unto all that thou hast.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7>   
<H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy     
shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing 
unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Ask thy young men, and they will show thee.    
Wherefore let the young men find favor in thine eyes: for we come in a good     
day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and  
to thy son David.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those  
words in the name of David, and ceased.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And Nabal answered David's servants, and said,  
Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days    
that break away every man from his master.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and   
my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know  
not whence they be?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD>
<TD><P>So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told 
him all those sayings.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And    
they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and     
there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the  
stuff.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>But   
one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent     
messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on         
them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>But    
the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any     
thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>They were a     
wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the 
sheep.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Now   
therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against   
our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that 
a man cannot speak to him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>     
18</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and    
two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched 
corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and    
laid them on asses.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after    
you. But she told not her husband Nabal.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she 
came down by the covert on the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down   
against her; and she met them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4> 
21</H4></TD><TD><P>Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this 
fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained 
unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>So and more also do ELOHIYM unto  
the enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning      
light any that pisseth against the wall.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and     
lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to    
the ground,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be: 
and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and hear the      
words of thine handmaid.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even       
Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him:  
but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>Now therefore,  
my lord, as YHVH liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing YHVH hath withholden    
thee from coming to shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand,  
now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And now this         
blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given   
unto the young men that follow my lord.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine      
handmaid: for YHVH will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord    
fighteth the battles of YHVH, and evil hath not been found in thee all thy      
days.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Yet a  
man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord      
shall be bound in the bundle of life with YHVH thy ELOHIYM; and the souls of    
thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And it shall    
come to pass, when YHVH shall have done to my lord according to all the good    
that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over   
Israel;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>That 
this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offense of heart unto my lord, either     
that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but  
when YHVH shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And David said  
to Abigail, Blessed be YHVH ELOHIYM of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet 
me:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And      
blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day from    
coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>For in very deed, as YHVH 
ELOHIYM of Israel liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except     
thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto      
Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>So David received of her hand 
that which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine      
house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>And Abigail     
came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a   
king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken:          
wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>But it came to pass  
in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him  
these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass  
about ten days after, that YHVH smote Nabal, that he died.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>And when David heard that Nabal   
was dead, he said, Blessed be YHVH, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach  
from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for YHVH hath      
returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed 
with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the servants of David were come to     
Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to     
take thee to him to wife.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>      
41</H4></TD><TD><P>And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth,   
and said, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the       
servants of my lord.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And Abigail hasted, and arose and rode upon an ass, with five       
damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of       
David, and became his wife.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>    
43</H4></TD><TD><P>David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both  
of them his wives.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son  
of Laish, which was of Gallim.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
