<p>1. ALL is with thee, O Indra, all the treasures which erst our fathers won who sang thy praises.<br> With thee are milch-kine good to milk, and horses: best winner thou of riches for the pious.<br> 2 For like a King among his wives thou dwellest: with glories, as a Sage, surround and help us.<br> Make us, thy servants, strong for wealth, and honour our songs wirth kine and steeds and decoration.<br> 3 Here these our holy hymns with joy and gladness in pious emulation have approached thee.<br> Hitherward come thy path that leads to riches: may we find shelter in thy favour, Indra.<br> 4 Vasi&#7779;&#7789;ha hath poured forth his prayers, desiring to milk thee like a cow in goodly pasture.<br> All these my people call thee Lord of cattle: may Indra. come unto the prayer we offer.<br> 5 What though the floods spread widely, Indra made them shallow and easy for Sud&#257;s to traverse.<br> He, worthy of our praises, caused the Simyu, foe of our hymn, to curse the rivers' fury.<br> 6 Eager for spoil was Turva&#347;a Purodas, fain to win wealth, like fishes urged by hunger.<br> The Bh&#7771;gus and the Druhyus quickly listened: friend rescued friend mid the two distant peoples.<br> 7 Together came the Pakthas, the Bhalanas, the Alinas, the Sivas, the Visanins.<br> Yet to the Trtsus came the &#256;rya's Comrade, through love of spoil and heroes' war, to lead them.<br> 8 Fools, in their folly fain to waste her waters, they parted inexhaustible Paru&#7779;&#7751;&#299;.<br> Lord of the Earth, he with his might repressed them: still lay the herd and the affrighted herdsman.<br> 9 As to their goal they sped to their destruetion: they sought Paru&#7779;&#7751;&#299;; e&#146;en the swift returned not.<br> Indra abandoned, to Sud&#257;s the manly, the swiftly flying foes, unmanly babblers.<br> 10 They went like kine unherded from the pasture, each clinging to a friend as chance directed.<br> They who drive spotted steeds, sent down by P&#7771;&#347;ni, gave ear, the Warriors and the harnessed horses.<br> 11 The King who scattered one-and-twenty people of both Vaikarna tribes through lust of glory-<br> As the skilled priest clips grass within the chamber, so hath the Hero Indra, wrought their downfall.<br> 12 Thou, thunder-armed, o&#146;erwhelmedst in the waters famed ancient Kavasa and then the Druhyu.<br> Others here claiming friendship to their friendship, devoted unto thee, in thee were joyful.<br> 13 Indra at once with conquering might demolished all their strong places and their seven castles.<br> The goods of Anu's son he gave to Trtsu. May we in sacrifice conquer scorned P&#363;ru.<br> 14 The Anavas and Druhyus, seeking booty, have slept, the sixty hundred, yea, six thousand,<br> And six-and-sixty heroes. For the pious were all these mighty exploits done by Indra.<br> 15 These Trtsus under Indra's careful guidance came speeding like loosed waters rushing downward.<br> The foemen, measuring exceeding closely, abandoned to Sud&#257;s all their provisions.<br> 16 The hero's side who drank the dressed oblation, Indra's denier, far o&#146;er earth he scattered.<br> Indra brought down the fierce destroyer's fury. He gave them various roads, the path's Controller.<br> 17 E&#146;en with the weak he wrought this matchless exploit: e&#146;en with a goat he did to death a lion.<br> He pared the pillar's angles with a needle. Thus to Sud&#257;s Indra gave all provisions.<br> 18 To thee have all thine enemies submitted: e&#146;en the fierce Bheda hast thou made thy subject.<br> Cast down thy sharpened thunderbolt, O Indra, on him who harms the men who sing thy praises.<br> 19 Yamuna and the Trtsus aided Indra. There he stripped Bheda bare of all his treasures.<br> The Ajas and the Sigrus and the Yaksus brought in to him as tribute heads of horses.<br> 20 Not to be scorned, but like Dawns past and recent, O Indra, are thy favours and thy riches.<br> Devaka, M&#257;nyamana's son, thou slewest, and smotest &#346;ambara from the lofty mountain.<br> 21 They who, from home, have gladdened thee, thy servants Parasara, Vasi&#7779;&#7789;ha, Satayatu,<br> Will not forget thy friendship, liberal Giver. So shall the days dawn prosperous for the princes.<br> 22 Priest-like, with praise, I move around the altar, earning Paijavana's reward, O Agni,<br> Two hundred cows from Devavan's descendant, two chariots from Sud&#257;s with mares to draw them.<br> 23 Gift of Paijavana, four horses bear me in foremost place, trained steeds with pearl to deck them.<br> Sud&#257;s's brown steeds, firmly-stepping, carry me and my son for progeny and glory.<br> 24 Him whose fame spreads between wide earth and heaven, who, as dispenser, gives each chief his portion,<br> Seven flowing Rivers glorify like Indra. He slew Yudhyamadhi in close encounter.<br> 25 Attend on him O ye heroic Maruts as on Sud&#257;s's father Divod&#257;sa.<br> Further Paijavana's desire with favour. Guard faithfully his lasting firm dominion.</p>
