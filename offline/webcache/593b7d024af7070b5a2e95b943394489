<p>1. LORD of the house, Sage, ever young, high power of life, O Agni, God,<br> Thou givest to thy worshipper.<br> 2 So with our song that prays and serves, attentive, Lord of spreading light,<br> Agni, bring hitherward the Gods.<br> 3 For, Ever-Youthful One, with thee, best Furtherer, as our ally,<br> We overcome, to win the spoil.<br> 4 As Aurva Bh&#7771;gu used, as Apnav&#257;na used, I call the pure<br> Agni who clothes him with the sea.<br> 5 1 call the Sage who sounds like wind, the Might that like Parjanya roars,<br> Agni who clothes him with the sea.<br> 6 As Savitar's productive Power, as him who sends down bliss, I call<br> Agni who clothes him with the sea.<br> 7 Hither, for powerful kirship, I call Agni, him Who prospers you,<br> Most frequent at our solemn rites<br> 8 That through this famed One's power, he may stand by us even as Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar comes<br> Unto the forms that must he shaped.<br> 9 This Agni is the Lord supreme above all glories mid the Gods:<br> May he come nigh to us with strength.<br> 10 Here praise ye him the most renowned of all the ministering Priests,<br> Agni, the Chief at sacrifice;<br> 11 Piercing, with purifying flame, enkindled in our homes, most high,<br> Swiftest to hear from far away.<br> 12 Sage, laud the Mighty One who wins the spoil of victory like a steed,<br> And, Mitra like, unites the folk.<br> 13 Still turning to their aim in thee, the oblation-bearer's sister hymns<br> Have come to thee before the wind.<br> 14 The waters find their place in him, for whom the threefold sacred grass<br> Is spread unbound, unlimited.<br> 15 The station of the Bounteous God hath, through his aid which none impair,<br> A pleasant aspect like the Sun.<br> 16 Blazing with splendour, Agni, God, through pious gifts of sacred oil,<br> Bring thou the Gods and worship them.<br> 17 The Gods as mothers brought thee forth, the Immortal Sage, O A&#7749;giras,<br> The bearer of our gifts to heaven.<br> 18 Wise Agni, Gods established thee, the Seer, noblest messenger,<br> As bearer of our sacred gifts.<br> 19 No cow have I to call mine own, no axe at hand wherewith to work,<br> Yet what is here I bring to thee.<br> 20 O Agni, whatsoever be the fuel that we lay for thee,<br> Be pleased therewith, Most Youthful God<br> 21 That which the white-ant cats away, that over which the emmet crawls-<br> May all of this be oil to thee.<br> 22 When he enkindles Agni, man should with his heart attend the song:<br> I with the priests have kindled him.</p>
