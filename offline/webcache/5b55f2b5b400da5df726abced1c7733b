<p>1. FILLED full of fatness, compassing all things that be, wide, spacious, dropping meath, beautiful in their form,<br> The Heaven and the Earth by Varu&#7751;a's decree, unwasting, rich in germs, stand parted each from each.<br> 2 The Everlasting Pair, with full streams, rich in milk, in their pure rule pour fatness for the pious man.<br> Ye who are Regents of this world, O Earth and Heaven, pour into us the genial flow that prospers meit.<br> 3 Whoso, for righteous life, pours offerings to you, O Heaven and Earth, ye Hemispheres, that man succeeds.<br> He in his seed is born again and spreads by Law: from you flow things diverse in form, but ruled alike.<br> 4 Enclosed in fatness, Heaven and Earth are bright therewith: they mingle with the fatness which they still increase.<br> Wide, broad, set foremost at election of the priest, to them the singers pray for bliss to further them.<br> 5 May Heaven and Earth pour down the balmy rain for us, balm-dropping, yielding balm, with balm upon your path,<br> Bestowing by your Godhead sacrifice and wealth, great fame and strength for us and good heroic might.<br> 6 May Heaven and Earth make food swell plenteously for us, all-knowing Father, jother, wondrous in their works.<br> Pouring out bounties, may, in union, both the Worlds, all beneficial, send us gain, and power, and wealth.</p>
