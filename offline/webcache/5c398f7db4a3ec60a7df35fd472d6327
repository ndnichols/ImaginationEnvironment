1</H4></TD><TD><P>Hear ye the word which YHVH speaketh unto you, O house of     
Israel:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus   
saith YHVH, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs  
of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>For the customs of the people are   
vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the    
workman, with the axe.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails   
and with hammers, that it move not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5> 
<H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they    
must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they    
cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Forasmuch as there is none like     
unto thee, O YHVH; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Who would not fear thee, O  
King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise 
men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>But they are      
altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine of vanities.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Silver spread into     
plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman,  
and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are    
all the work of cunning men.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>   
10</H4></TD><TD><P>But YHVH is the true ELOHIYM, he is the living ELOHIYM, and  
an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations      
shall not be able to abide his indignation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have 
not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and  
from under these heavens.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>      
12</H4></TD><TD><P>He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the 
world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>When he         
uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he       
causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings  
with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Every man is brutish in his   
knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten      
image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>They are vanity, and the work of  
errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>The portion of Jacob is not like  
them: for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the rod of his          
inheritance: YHVH of hosts is his name.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Gather up thy wares out of the land, O          
inhabitant of the fortress.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>    
18</H4></TD><TD><P>For thus saith YHVH, Behold, I will sling out the            
inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may     
find it so.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous; but I said, Truly this is a grief, 
and I must bear it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD>
<TD><P>My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are   
gone forth of me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my tent any  
more, and to set up my curtains.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21>   
<H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought  
YHVH: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be           
scattered.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north  
country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a den of dragons.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>O YHVH, I know that  
the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his   
steps.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>O     
YHVH, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to  
nothing.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families    
that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and  
consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
