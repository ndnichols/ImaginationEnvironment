<p>1. HERE present this Immortal God flies, like a bird upon her wings,<br> To settle in the vats of wood.<br> 2 This God, made ready with the hymn, runs swiftly through the winding ways,<br> Inviolable as he flows.<br> 3 This God while flowing is adorned, like a bay steed for war, by men<br> Devout and skilled in holy songs.<br> 4 He, like a warrior going forth with heroes, as he flows along<br> Is fain to win all precious boons.<br> 5 This God, as he is flowing on, speeds like a car and gives his gifts:<br> He lets his voice be heard of all<br> 6 Praised by the sacred bards, this God dives into waters, and bestows<br> Rich gifts upon the worshipper.<br> 7 Away he rushes with his stream, across the regions, into heaven,<br> And roars as he is flowing on.<br> 8 While flowing, meet for sacrifice, he hath gone up to heaven across<br> The regions, irresistible.<br> 9 After the 'way of ancient time, this God, pressed out for Deities,<br> Flows tawny to the straining-cloth.<br> 10 This Lord of many Holy Laws, even at his birth engendering strength,<br> Effused, flows onward in a stream.</p>
