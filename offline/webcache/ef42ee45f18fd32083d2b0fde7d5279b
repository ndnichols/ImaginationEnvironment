<TD><P>Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed  
him, and said, Is it not because YHVH hath anointed thee to be captain over his 
inheritance?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>  
When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's 
sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The 
asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the   
care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my        
son?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Then      
shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of       
Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to ELOHIYM to Bethel, one   
carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another    
carrying a bottle of wine:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread; which 
thou shalt receive of their hands.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5>  
<H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>After that thou shalt come to the hill of ELOHIYM, where  
is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art    
come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming     
down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, 
before them; and they shall prophesy:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And the Spirit of YHVH will come upon thee, and   
thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And let it be, when    
these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion serve thee; for        
ELOHIYM is with thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come     
down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace  
offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and show thee what 
thou shalt do.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>
And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, ELOHIYM gave 
him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they came thither to 
the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of ELOHIYM came 
upon him, and he prophesied among them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, when all that knew him     
beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people  
said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul    
also among the prophets?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their       
father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he had made 
an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And Saul's uncle said unto him    
and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when   
we saw that they were no where, we came to Samuel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I 
pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us        
plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof    
Samuel spake, he told him not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4> 
17</H4></TD><TD><P>And Samuel called the people together unto YHVH to           
Mizpeh;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith YHVH ELOHIYM of Israel, I brought  
up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and 
out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And ye have this day      
rejected your ELOHIYM, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and    
your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us. Now  
therefore present yourselves before YHVH by your tribes, and by your            
thousands.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of  
Benjamin was taken.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD>
<TD><P>When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, 
the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when     
they sought him, he could not be found.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore they inquired of YHVH further, if the 
man should yet come thither. And YHVH answered, Behold he hath hid himself      
among the stuff.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people, 
he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And Samuel said to   
all the people, See ye him whom YHVH hath chosen, that there is none like him   
among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, save the king.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Samuel     
told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it  
up before YHVH. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And Saul also   
went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts        
ELOHIYM had touched.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And    
they despised him, and brought no presents. But he held his peace.</P></TD></TR>
