looketh toward the east:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And, behold, the glory of the ELOHIYM of Israel came from the way   
of the east: and his voice was like a noise of many waters: and the earth       
shined with his glory.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw,   
even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and    
the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell     
upon my face.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And the glory of YHVH came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect 
is toward the east.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and,      
behold, the glory of YHVH filled the house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And I heard him speaking unto me out of the       
house; and the man stood by me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4> 
7</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and  
the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the       
children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no     
more defile, neither they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the       
carcases of their kings in their high places.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>In their setting of their threshold by my      
thresholds, and their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they  
have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed:  
wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Now let them put away their whoredom, and the  
carcases of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for 
ever.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou   
son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of  
their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And if they be ashamed of all     
that they have done, shew them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof,  
and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms       
thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the 
laws thereof: and write it in their sight, that they may keep the whole form    
thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>This is the law of the house;     
Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most  
holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

the cubits: The cubit is a cubit and an hand breadth; even the bottom shall be  
a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof    
round about shall be a span: and this shall be the higher place of the          
altar.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle shall be two cubits,

fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof; and the    
border about it shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit  
about; and his stairs shall look toward the east.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto me, Son of man,

blood thereon.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD>

cleanse it with the bullock.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>   
23</H4></TD><TD><P>When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer 
a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.</P>
