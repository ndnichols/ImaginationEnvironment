<p>1. WHAT, dearest Pair, is this in strength and riches that ye as Priests are bring from the waters?<br> This sacrifice is your glorification, ye who protect mankind and give them treasures.<br> 2 May your pure steeds, rain-drinkers, bring you hither, swift as the tempest, your celestial coursers,<br> Rapid as thought, with fair backs, full of vigour, resplendent in their native light, O A&#347;vins.<br> 3 Your car is like a torrent rushing downward: may it come nigh, broad-seated, for our welfare,&#151;<br> Car holy, strong, that ever would be foremost, thought-swift, which ye, for whom we long, have mounted.<br> 4 Here sprung to life, they both have sung together, with bodies free from stain, with signs that mark them;<br> One of you Prince of Sacrifice, the Victor, the other counts as Heaven's auspicious offspring.<br> 5 May your car-seat, down-gliding, golden-coloured, according to your wish approach our dwellings.<br> Men shall feed full the bay steeds of the other, and, A&#347;vins they with roars shall stir the regions.<br> 6 Forth comes your strong Bull like a cloud of autumn, sending abundant food of liquid sweetness.<br> Let them feed with the other's ways and vigour: the upper streams have come and do us service.<br> 7 Your constant song hath been sent forth, Disposers! that flows threefold in mighty strength, O A&#347;vins.<br> Thus lauded, give the suppliant protection moving or resting hear mine invocation.<br> 8 This song of bright contents for you is swelling in the men's hall where three-fold grass is ready.<br> Your strong rain-cloud, ye Mighty Ones, hath swollen, honouring men as &#146;twere with milk's outpouring.<br> 9 The prudent worshipper, like P&#363;&#7779;an, A&#347;vins! praises you as he praises Dawn and Agni,<br> When, singing with devotion, he invokes you. May we find strengthening food in full abundance.</p>
