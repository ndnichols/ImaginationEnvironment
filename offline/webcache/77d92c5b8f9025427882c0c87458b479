that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews' enemy unto    
Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what   
he was unto her.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it   
unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And Esther spake yet again  
before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put  
away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised      
against the Jews.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD>
<P>Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose,    
and stood before the king,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And said, If it please the king, and if I have favour in his sight, 
and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it 
be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the    
Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king's         
provinces:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>For 
how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I   
endure to see the destruction of my kindred?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the      
queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman,  
and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the    
Jews.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Write ye 
also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king's name, and seal it with the   
king's ring: for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed    
with the king's ring, may no man reverse.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Then were the king's scribes called at that time  
in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day    
thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the   
Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces      
which are from India unto Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto 
every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after    
their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to    
their language.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus' name, and sealed it with the king's      
ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and riders on mules, camels, and  
young dromedaries:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather     
themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay and to    
cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault    
them, both little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Upon one day in 
all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the     
twelfth month, which is the month Adar.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>The copy of the writing for a commandment to be 
given in every province was published unto all people, and that the Jews should 
be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>So the posts that rode    
upon mules and camels went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king's     
commandment. And the decree was given at Shushan the palace.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And Mordecai went out from    
the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great   
crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of     
Shushan rejoiced and was glad.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>

</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And in every    
province, and in every city, whithersoever the king's commandment and his       
decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of 
the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.</P>
