<p>1. SLAYERS of enemies, Indra and Agni, accept this day our new-born pure laudation.<br> Again, again I call you prompt to listen, best to give quickly strength to him who craves it.<br> 2 For ye were strong to gain, exceeding mighty, growing together, waxing in your vigour.<br> Lords of the pasture filled with ample riches, bestow upon us strength both fresh and lasting.<br> 3 Yea when the strong have entered our assembly, and singers seeking with their hymns your favour,<br> They are like steeds who come into the race-course, those men who call aloud on Indra-Agni.<br> 4 The singer, seeking with his hymns your favour, begs splendid riches of their first possessor.<br> Further us with new bounties, Indra-Agni, armed with strong thunder, slayers of the foeman.<br> 5 When two great hosts, arrayed against each other, meet clothed with brightness, in the fierce encounter<br> Stand ye beside the godly, smite the godless; and still assist the men who press the Soma.<br> 6 To this our Soma-pressing, Indra-Agni, come ye prepared to show your loving-kindness,<br> For not at any time have ye despised us. So may I draw you with all strengthenings hither.<br> 7 So Agni, kindled mid this adoration, invite thou Mitra, Varu&#7751;a, and Indra.<br> Forgive whatever sin we have committed may Aryaman and Aditi remove it.<br> 8 While we accelerate these our sacrifices, may we win strength from both of you, O Agni:<br> Ne&#146;er may the Maruts, Indra, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u slight us. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
