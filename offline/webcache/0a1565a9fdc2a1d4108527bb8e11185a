<p>1. HELPED, Indra Maghavan, by thee in war of old, may we subdue in fight the men who strive with us, conquer the men who war with us.<br> This day that now is close at hand bless him who pours the Soma juice.<br> In this our sacrifice may we divide the spoil, showing our strength, the spoil of war.<br> 2 In war which wins the light, at the free-giver's call, at due oblation of the early-rising one, oblation of the active one,<br> Indra slew, even as we know&#151;whom each bowed head must reverence.<br> May all thy bounteous gifts be gathered up for us, yea, the good gifts of thee the Good.<br> 3 This food glows for thee as of old at sacrifice, wherein they made thee chooser of the place, for thou choosest the place of sacrifice.<br> Speak thou and make it known to us: they see within with beams of light.<br> Indra, indeed, is found a seeker after spoil, spoil-seeker for his own allies.<br> 4 So now must thy great deed be lauded as of old, when for the A&#7749;girases thou openedst the stall, openedst, giving aid, the stall.<br> In the same manner for us here fight thou and be victorious:<br> To him who pours the juice give up the lawless man, the lawless who is wroth with us.<br> 5 When with wise plan the Hero leads the people forth, they conquer in the ordered battle, seeking fame, press, eager, onward seeking fame.<br> To him in time of need they sing for life with offspring and with strength.<br> Their hymns with Indra find a welcome place of rest: the hymns go forward to the Gods.<br> 6 Indra and Parvata, our champions in the fight, drive ye away each man who fain would war with us, drive him far from us with the bolt.<br> Welcome to him concealed afar shall he the lair that he hath found.<br> So may the Render rend our foes on every side, rend them, O Hero, everywhere.</p>
