<p>1. Ho there, my consort! Stay, thou fierce-souled lady, and let us reason for a while together.<br> Such thoughts as these of ours, while yet unspoken in days gone by have never brought us comfort.<br> 2 What am I now to do with this thy saying? I have gone from thee like the first of Mornings.<br> Pur&#363;ravas, return thou to thy dwelling: I, like the wind, am difficult to capture.<br> 3 Like a shaft sent for glory from the quiver, or swift-steed winning cattle winning hundreds.<br> The lightning seemed to flash, as cowards planned it. The minstrels bleated like a lamb in trouble.<br> 4 Giving her husband's father life and riches, from the near dwelling, when her lover craved her,<br> She sought the home wherein she found her pleasure, accepting day and night her lord's embraces.<br> 5 Thrice in the day didst thou embrace thy consort, though coldly she received thy fond caresses.<br> To thy desires, Pur&#363;ravas, I yielded: so wast thou king, O hero, of my body.<br> 6 The maids Sujirni, Sreni, Sumne-api, Charanyu, Granthini, and Hradecaksus,&#151;<br> These like red kine have hastened forth, the bright ones, and like milch-cows have lowed in emulation.<br> 7 While he was born the Dames sate down together, the Rivers with free kindness gave him nurture;<br> And then, Pur&#363;ravas, the Gods increased thee for mighty battle, to destroy the Dasyus.<br> 8 When I, a mortal, wooed to mine embraces these heavenly nymphs who laid aside their raiment,<br> Like a scared snake they fled from me in terror, like chariot horses when the car has touched them.<br> 9 When, loving these Immortal Ones, the mortal hath converse with the nymphs as they allow him.<br> Like swans they show the beauty of their bodies, like horses in their play they bite and nibble.<br> 10 She who flashed brilliant as the falling lightning brought me delicious presents from the waters.<br> Now from the flood be born a strong young hero May Uruvasi prolong her life for ever<br> 11 Thy birth hath made me drink from earthly milch-kine: this power, Pur&#363;ravas, hast thou vouchsafed me.<br> I knew, and, warned thee, on that day. Thou wouldst not hear me. What sayest thou, when naught avails thee?<br> 12 When will the son be born and seek his father? Mourner-like, will he weep when first he knows him?<br> Who shall divide the accordant wife and husband, while fire is shining with thy consort's parents?<br> 13 I will console him when his tears are falling: he shall not weep and cry for care that blesses.<br> That which is thine, between us, will I send thee. Go home again, thou fool;&#7789;hou hast not won me.<br> 14 Thy lover shall flee forth this day for ever, to seek, without return, the farthest distance.<br> Then let his bed be in Destruction's bosom, and there let fierce rapacious wolves devour him.<br> 15 Nay, do not die, Pur&#363;ravas, nor vanish: let not the evil-omened wolves devour thee.<br> With women there can be no lasting friendship: hearts of hyenas are the hearts of women.<br> 16 When amid men in altered shape I sojourned, and through four autumns spent the nights among them,<br> I tasted once a day a drop of butter; and even now with that am I am contented.<br> 17 I, her best love, call Urvasi to meet me, her who fills air and measures out the region.<br> Let the gift brought by piety approach thee. Turn thou to me again: my heart is troubled.<br> 18 Thus speak these Gods to thee, O son of I&#7735;&#257;: As death hath verily got thee for his subject,<br> Thy sons shall serve the Gods with their oblation, and thou, moreover, shalt rejoice in Svarga.</p>
