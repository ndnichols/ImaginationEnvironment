<p>1. COME, lauded, unto us with powers and succours, O Indra, with thy Tawny Steeds; exulting,<br> Past even the foeman's manifold libations, glorified with our hymns, true Wealth-bestower.<br> 2 Man's Friend, to this our sacrifice he cometh marking how he is called by Soma-pressers.<br> Fearless, and conscious that his Steeds are noble, he joyeth with the Soma-pouring heroes.<br> 3 Make his cars hear, that he may show his vigour and may be joyful in the way he loveth.<br> May mighty Indra pouring forth in bounty bestow on us good roads and perfect safety;<br> 4 He who with succour comes to his implorer, the singer here who with his song invites him;<br> He who himself sets to the pole swift Coursers, he who hath hundreds, thousands, Thunder-wielder.<br> 5 O Indra Maghavan, by thee protected may we be thine, princes and priests and singers,<br> Sharing the riches sent from lofty heaven which yields much food, and all desire its bounty.</p>
