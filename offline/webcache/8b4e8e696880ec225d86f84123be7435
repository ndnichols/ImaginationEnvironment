<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass in the      
fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that this word came   
unto Jeremiah from YHVH, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>
2</H4></TD><TD><P>Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words   
that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all 
the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto 
this day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>It   
may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do     
unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive 
their iniquity and their sin.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>   
4</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch     
wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of YHVH, which he had spoken     
unto him, upon a roll of a book.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>
5</H4></TD><TD><P>And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot 
go into the house of YHVH:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written    
from my mouth, the words of YHVH in the ears of the people in YHVH's house upon 
the fasting day: and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that    
come out of their cities.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>It may be they will present their supplication before YHVH, and     
will return every one from his evil way: for great is the anger and the fury    
that YHVH hath pronounced against this people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to  
all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of   
YHVH in YHVH's house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah     
king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before YHVH to   
all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the cities of 
Judah unto Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of  
YHVH, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher   
court, at the entry of the new gate of YHVH's house, in the ears of all the     
people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>When 
Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all 
the words of YHVH,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and, 
lo, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of 
Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and  
Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Michaiah declared unto them  
all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the   
people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>     
Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of          
Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the roll   
wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son   
of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And they said unto him, Sit down  
now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Now it came to pass, when     
they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said     
unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And they asked Baruch,        
saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Baruch answered 
them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them    
with ink in the book.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and          
Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And they went in to the king into the court,    
but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all   
the words in the ears of the king.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21> 
<H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took   
it out of Elishama the scribe's chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the  
king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Now the king sat in  
the winterhouse in the ninth month: and there was a fire on the hearth burning  
before him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it  
with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until all  
the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Yet they were not afraid, nor     
rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all   
these words.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>
Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the     
king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>But the king commanded    
Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah    
the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but YHVH 
hid them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Then the word of YHVH came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the      
roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Take thee again 
another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, 
which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of      
Judah, Thus saith YHVH; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou       
written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy   
this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore thus saith YHVH of  
Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David:    
and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to 
the frost.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I   
will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men   
of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened  
not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>Then    
took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of        
Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book  
which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added      
besides unto them many like words.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
