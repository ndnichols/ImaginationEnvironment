<p>1. AGNI hath looked, benevolently-minded, on the wealth-giving spring of radiant Mornings.<br> Come, A&#347;vins, to the dwelling of the pious: S&#363;rya the God is rising with his splendour.<br> 2 Savitar, God, hath spread on high his lustre, waving his flag like a spoil-seeking hero.<br> Their stablished way go Varu&#7751;a and Mitra, what time they make the Sun ascend the heaven.<br> 3 Him whom they made to drive away the darkness, Lords of sure mansions, constant to their object,<br> Him who beholds the universe, the Sun-God, seven strong and youthful Coursers carry onward.<br> 4 Spreading thy web with mightiest Steeds thou comest, rending apart, thou God, the black-hued mantle.<br> The rays of S&#363;rya tremulously shining sink, like a hide, the darkness in the waters.<br> 5 How is it that, unbound and not supported, he falleth not although directed downward?<br> By what self power moves he? Who hath seen it? He guards the vault of heaven, a close-set pillar.</p>
