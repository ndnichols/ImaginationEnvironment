<p>1. FOR first possession of your juice, for the exhilarating drink,<br> Drive ye away the dog, my friends, drive ye the long-tongued dog away.<br> 2 He who with purifying stream, effused, comes flowing hitherward,<br> Indu, is like an able steed.<br> 3 The men with all-pervading song send unassailable Soma forth,<br> By pressing-stones, to sacrifice.<br> 4 The Somas, very rich in sweets, for which the sieve is destined, flow,<br> Effused, the source of Indra's joy: may your strong juices reach the Gods.<br> 5 Indu flows on for Indra's sake: thus have the Deities declared.<br> The Lord of Speech exerts himself, Ruler of all, because of might.<br> 6 Inciter of the voice of song, with thousand streams the ocean flows,<br> Even Soma, Lord of opulence, the Friend of Indra, day by day.<br> 7 As P&#363;&#7779;an, Fortune, Bhaga, comes this Soma while they make him pure.<br> He, Lord of the multitude, hath looked upon the earth and heaven.<br> 8 The dear cows lowed in joyful mood together to the gladdening drink.<br> The drops as they were purified, the Soma juices, made then paths.<br> 9 O Pavamana, bring the juice, the mightiest, worthy to be famed,<br> Which the Five Tribes have over them, whereby we may win opulence.<br> 10 For us the Soma juices flow, the drops best furtherers of our weal,<br> Effused as friends without a spot, benevolent, finders of the light.<br> 11 Effused by means of pressing-stones, upon the ox-hide visible,<br> They, treasure-finders, have announced food unto us from every side.<br> 12 Tlese Soma juices, skilled in song, purified, blent with milk and curd,<br> When moving and when firmly laid in oil, resemble lovely Suns.<br> 13 Let not the power of men restrain the voice of the outpouring juice:<br> As Bh&#7771;gu's sons chased Makha, so drive ye the greedy hound away.<br> 14 The Friend hath wrapped him in his robe, as in his parents arms, a son.<br> He went, as lover to a dame, to take his station suitor-like.<br> 15 That Hero who produces strength, he who hath propped both worlds apart,<br> Gold-hued, hath wrapped him in the sieve, to settle, priest-like, in his place.<br> 16 Soma upon the ox's skin through the sheep's wool flows purified.<br> Bellowing out, the Tawny Steer goes on to Indra's special place.</p>
