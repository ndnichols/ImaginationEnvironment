<p>1. WE as thy friends have chosen thee, mortals a God, to be our help,<br> The Waters&#146; Child, the blessed, the resplendent One, victorious and beyond compare.<br> 2 Since thou delighting in the woods hast gone unto thy mother streams,<br> Not to be scorned, Agni, is that return of thine when from afar thou now art here.<br> 3 O'er pungent smoke host thou prevailed, and thus art thou benevolent.<br> Some go before, and others round about thee sit, they in whose friendship thou hast place.<br> 4 Him who had passed beyond his foes, beyond continual pursuits, Him the unerring Ones, observant, found in floods, couched like a lion in his lair.<br> 5 Him wandering at his own free will, Agni here hidden from our view,<br> Him M&#257;tari&#347;van brought to us from far away produced by friction, from the Gods.<br> 6 O Bearer of Oblations, thus mortals received thee from the Gods,<br> Whilst thou, the Friend of man, guardest each sacrifice with thine own power, Most Youthful One.<br> 7 Amid thy wonders this is good, yea, to the simple is it clear,<br> When gathered round about thee, Agni, lie the herds where thou art kindled in the morn.<br> 8 Offer to him who knows fair rites, who burns with purifying glow,<br> Swift envoy, active, ancient, and adorable: serve ye the God attentively.<br> 9 Three times a hundred Gods and thrice a thousand, and three times ten and nine have worshipped Agni,<br> For him spread sacred grass, with oil bedewed him, and stablished him as Priest and Sacrificer.</p>
