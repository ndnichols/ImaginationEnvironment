<TD><P>After these things YAHSHUA shewed himself again to the disciples at the  
sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>There were together Simon Peter,    
and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of    
Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They 
say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship    
immediately; and that night they caught nothing.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>But when the morning was now come,  
YAHSHUA stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was YAHSHUA.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Then YAHSHUA      
saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, 
Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast        
therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of           
fishes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>       
Therefore that disciple whom YAHSHUA loved saith unto Peter, It is the ADONAY.  
Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the ADONAY, he girt his fisher's coat    
unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And the other disciples     
came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two     
hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>As soon then as they were come to land, they   
saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA saith unto them,      
Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land   
full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so 
many, yet was not the net broken.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12>  
<H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the  
disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the ADONAY.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA then cometh, 
and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>This is now the third time that   
YAHSHUA shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the       
dead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>So     
when they had dined, YAHSHUA saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest  
thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, ADONAY; thou knowest that I    
love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>He saith to him again the second time, Simon,   
son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, ADONAY; thou knowest that 
I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son 
of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third  
time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, ADONAY, thou knowest all things;    
thou knowest that I love thee. YAHSHUA saith unto him, Feed my sheep.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Verily, verily, I    
say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdest thyself, and walkedst whither 
thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands,  
and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>This spake he,       
signifying by what death he should glorify ELOHIYM. And when he had spoken      
this, he saith unto him, Follow me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20>
<H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom       
YAHSHUA loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said,   
ADONAY, which is he that betrayeth thee?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Peter seeing him saith to YAHSHUA, ADONAY, and  
what shall this man do?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what   
is that to thee? follow thou me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23>   
<H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that    
that disciple should not die: yet YAHSHUA said not unto him, He shall not die;  
but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>This is the disciple      
which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his  
testimony is true.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And there are also many other things which YAHSHUA did, the which, if    
they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could    
not contain the books that should be written. Amen.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
