<p>1. THAT highest Indra-power of thine is distant: that which is here sages possessed aforetime.<br> This one is on the earth, in heaven the other, and both unite as flag with flag in battle.<br> 2 He spread the wide earth out and firmly fixed it, smote with his thunderbolt and loosed the waters.<br> Maghavan with his puissance struck down Ahi, rent Rauhi&#7751;a to death and slaughtered Vya&#7745;sa.<br> 3 Armed with his bolt and trusting in his prowess he wandered shattering the forts of D&#257;sas.<br> Cast thy dart, knowing, Thunderer, at the Dasyu; increase the &#256;rya's might and glory, Indra.<br> 4 For him who thus hath taught these human races, Maghavan, bearing a fame-worthy title,<br> Thunderer, drawing nigh to slay the Dasyus, hath given himself the name of Son for glory.<br> 5 See this abundant wealth that he possesses, and put your trust in Indra's hero vigour.<br> He found the cattle, and he found the horses, he found the plants, the forests and the waters.<br> 6 To him the truly strong, whose deeds are many, to him the strong Bull let us pour the Soma.<br> The Hero, watching like a thief in ambush, goes parting the possessions of the godless.<br> 7 Well didst thou do that hero deed, O Indra, in waking with thy bolt the slumbering Ahi.<br> in thee, delighted, Dames divine rejoiced them, the flying Maruts and all Gods were joyful.<br> 8 As thou hast smitten &#346;u&#7779;&#7751;a, Pipru, V&#7771;tra and Kuyava, and &#346;ambara's forts<font size="-1" color="green">,</font> O Indra.<br> This prayer of ours may Varu&#7751;a grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu, Earth and Heaven.</p>
