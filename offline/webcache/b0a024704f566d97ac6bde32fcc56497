<p>1 WE seeking strength with Soma-drops fill full your Indra like a well,<br> Most liberal, Lord of Hundred Powers,<br> 2 Who lets a hundred of the pure, a thousand of the milk-blent draughts<br> Flow, even as down a depth, to him;<br> 3 When for the strong, the rapturous joy he in this manner hath made room<br> Within his belly, like the sea.<br> 4 This is thine own. Thou drawest near, as turns a pigeon to his mate:<br> Thou carest too for this our prayer.<br> 5 O Hero, Lord of Bounties, praised in hymns, may power and joyfulness<br> Be his who sings the laud to thee.<br> 6 Lord of a Hundred Powers, stand up to lend us succour in this fight<br> In others too let us agree.<br> 7 In every need, in every fray we call as friends to succour us<br> Indra the mightiest of all.<br> 8 If he will hear us let him come with succour of a thousand kinds,<br> And all that strengthens, to our call.<br> 9 I call him mighty to resist, the Hero of our ancient home,<br> Thee whom my sire invoked of old.<br> 10 We pray to thee, O much-invoked, rich in all precious gifts, O Friend,<br> Kind God to those who sing thy praise.<br> 11 O Soma-drinker, Thunder-armed, Friend of our lovely-featured dames<br> And of our Soma-drinking friends.<br> 12 Thus, Soma-drinker, may it be; thus, Friend, who wieldest thunder, act<br> To aid each wish as we desire.<br> 13 With Indra splendid feasts be ours, rich in all strengthening things wherewith,<br> Wealthy in food, we may rejoice.<br> 14 Like thee, thyself, the singers' Friend, thou movest, as it were, besought,<br> Bold One, the axle of the car.<br> 15 That, &#346;atakratu, thou to grace and please thy praisers, as it were,<br> Stirrest the axle with thy strength.<br> 16 With champing, neighing loudly-snorting horses Indra hath ever won himself great treasures<br> A car of gold hath he whose deeds are wondrous received from us, and let us too receive it.<br> 17 Come, A&#347;vins, with enduring strength wealthy in horses and in kine,<br> And gold, O ye of wondrous deeds.<br> 18 Your chariot yoked for both alike, immortal, ye of mighty acts,<br> Travels, O A&#347;vins, in the sea.<br> 19 High on the forehead of the Bull one chariot wheel ye ever keep,<br> The other round the sky revolves.<br> 20 What mortal, O immortal Dawn, enjoyeth thee? Where lovest thou?<br> To whom, O radiant, dost thou go?<br> 21 For we have had thee in our thoughts whether anear or far away,<br> Red-hued and like a dappled mare.<br> 22 Hither, O Daughter of the Sky, come thou with these thy strengthenings,<br> And send thou riches down to us.</p>
