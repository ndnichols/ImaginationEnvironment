<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Also, thou son of man, thus 
saith the ADONAY YHVH unto the land of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the 
four corners of the land.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>Now is the end come upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon      
thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense upon thee  
all thine abominations.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I  
will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the      
midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH; An      
evil, an only evil, behold, is come.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6>
<H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee;    
behold, it is come.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the     
time is come, the day of trouble is near, and not the sounding again of the     
mountains.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Now 
will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger upon thee:

thine abominations.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD>

recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that are in the    
midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am YHVH that smiteth.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Behold the day, behold, it is 
come: the morning is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Violence is     
risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them shall remain, nor of their      
multitude, nor of any of their's: neither shall there be wailing for them.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>The time is     
come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn:    
for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>For the seller shall not return to that which   
is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole     
multitude thereof, which shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself 
in the iniquity of his life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>   
14</H4></TD><TD><P>They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but     
none goeth to the battle: for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>The sword is    
without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field      
shall die with the sword; and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence     
shall devour him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains 
like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>All hands shall 
be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>They shall also gird themselves   
with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, 
and baldness upon all their heads.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19> 
<H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their   
gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver 
them in the day of the wrath of YHVH: they shall not satisfy their souls,       
neither fill their bowels: because it is the stumblingblock of their            
iniquity.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>As 
for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images  
of their abominations and of their detestable things therein: therefore have I  
set it far from them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4>

to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>My face will I turn also  
from them, and they shall pollute my secret place: for the robbers shall enter  
into it, and defile it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city   
is full of violence.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall     
possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and     
their holy places shall be defiled.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25>
<H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there 
shall be none.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then     
shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the      
priest, and counsel from the ancients.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be       
troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts   
will I judge them; and they shall know that I am YHVH.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
