<p>1. To the great Hero, him who sets his mind thereon, and Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, praise aloud in song your draught of juice,&#151;<br> Gods ne&#146;er beguiled, who borne as &#146;twere by noble steed, have stood upon the lofty ridges of the hills.<br> 2 Your Soma-drinker keeps afar your furious rush, Indra and Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, when ye come with all your might.<br> That which hath been directed well at mortal man, bow-armed K&#7771;&#347;&#257;nu's arrow, ye turn far aside.<br> 3 These offerings increase his mighty manly strength: he brings both Parents down to share the genial flow.<br> He lowers, though a son, the Father's highest name; the third is that which is high in the light of heaven.<br> 4 We laud this manly power of him the Mighty One, preserver, inoffensive, bounteous and benign;<br> His who strode, widely pacing, with three steppings forth over the realms of earth for freedom and for life.<br> 5 A mortal man, when he beholds two steps of him who looks upon the light, is restless with amaze.<br> But his third step doth no one venture to approach, no, nor the feathered birds of air who fly with wings.<br> 6 He, like a rounded wheel, hath in swift motion set his ninety racing steeds together with the four.<br> Developed, vast in form, with those who sing forth praise, a youth, no more a child, he cometh to our call.</p>
