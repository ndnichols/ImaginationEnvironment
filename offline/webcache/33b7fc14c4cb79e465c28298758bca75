<p>1. SAVITAR God of all men hath sent upward his light, designed for all mankind, immortal.<br> Through the Gods&#146; power that Eye was first created. Dawn hath made all the universe apparent.<br> 2 I see the paths which Gods are wont to travel, innocuous paths made ready by the Vasus.<br> Eastward the flag of Dawn hath been uplifted; she hath come hither o&#146;er the tops of houses.<br> 3 Great is, in truth, the number of the Mornings which were aforetime at the Sun's uprising.<br> Since thou, O Dawn, hast been beheld repairing as to thy love, as one no more to leave him.<br> 4 They were the Gods&#146; companions at the banquet, the ancient sages true to Law Eternal.<br> The Fathers found the light that lay in darkness, and with effectual words begat the Morning.<br> 5 Meeting together in the same enclosure, they strive not, ofone mind, one with another.<br> They never break the Gods&#146; eternal statutes, and injure none, in rivalry with Vasus.<br> 6 Extolling thee, Blest Goddess, the Vasisthas, awake at early mom, with lauds implore thee.<br> Leader of kine and Queen of all that strengthens, shine, come as first to us, O high-born Morning.<br> 7 She bringeth bounty and sweet charm of voices. The flushing Dawn is sung by the Vasisthas,<br> Giving us riches famed to distant places. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
