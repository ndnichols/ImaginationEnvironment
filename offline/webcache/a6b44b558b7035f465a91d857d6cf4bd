</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>Paul, an apostle  
of YAHSHUA MASHIYACH by the will of ELOHIYM, and Timothy our brother, unto the  
church of ELOHIYM which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all     
Achaia:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Grace  
be to you and peace from EL our Father, and from the ADONAY YAHSHUA             
MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Blessed be EL, even the Father of our ADONAY YAHSHUA MASHIYACH, the Father of   
mercies, and the EL of all comfort;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4> 
<H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be  
able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we      
ourselves are comforted of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5> 
<H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>For as the sufferings of MASHIYACH abound in us, so our   
consolation also aboundeth by MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And whether we be afflicted, it is for your       
consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same       
sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your     
consolation and salvation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers  
of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>For we would not, brethren, have    
you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out  
of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>But we had the         
sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in   
ELOHIYM which raiseth the dead:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>
10</H4></TD><TD><P>Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in 
whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that 
for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given  
by many on our behalf.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in 
simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of    
ELOHIYM, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to      
you-ward.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>   
For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and  
I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>As also ye have acknowledged us in part,     
that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are our's in the day of the ADONAY  
YAHSHUA.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a   
second benefit;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto   
you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>When I therefore was thus minded, 
did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to    
the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>But as ELOHIYM is true, our   
word toward you was not yea and nay.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>For the Son of ELOHIYM, YAHSHUA MASHIYACH, who  
was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not    
yea and nay, but in him was yea.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20>   
<H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>For all the promises of ELOHIYM in him are yea, and in   
him Amen, unto the glory of EL by us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Now he which stablisheth us with you in         
MASHIYACH, and hath anointed us, is ELOHIYM;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest  
of the Spirit in our hearts.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>   
23</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover I call ELOHIYM for a record upon my soul, that to   
spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Not for that we have dominion over your faith,  
but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
