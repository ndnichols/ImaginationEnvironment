<TD><P>Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the    
tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon   
in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of YHVH out of   
the city of David, which is Zion.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2>   
<H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king  
Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And all the elders of  
Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And they brought up the ark of YHVH, and the   
tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the       
tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring up.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And king Solomon, and all   
the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before  
the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for    
multitude.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of YHVH unto his place, into the 
oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the        
cherubim.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>For  
the cherubim spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark, and the    
cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And they drew out the staves, that  
the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and   
they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>There was nothing in the ark    
save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when YHVH made a  
covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of         
Egypt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the     
cloud filled the house of YHVH,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>
11</H4></TD><TD><P>So that the priests could not stand to minister because of   
the cloud: for the glory of YHVH had filled the house of YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Then spake Solomon, YHVH said 
that he would dwell in the thick darkness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>I have surely built thee an house to dwell in,  
a settled place for thee to abide in for ever.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And the king turned his face about, and      
blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel     
stood;)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
he said, Blessed be YHVH ELOHIYM of Israel, which spake with his mouth unto     
David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Since the day that I brought  
forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of   
Israel to build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to   
be over my people Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>      
17</H4></TD><TD><P>And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house 
for the name of YHVH ELOHIYM of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH said unto David my father, Whereas it  
was in thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was  
in thine heart.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD>
<P>Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come     
forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH hath performed his   
word that he spake, and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit   
on the throne of Israel, as YHVH promised, and have built an house for the name 
of YHVH of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of     
YHVH, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of   
Egypt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
Solomon stood before the altar of YHVH in the presence of all the congregation  
of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, YHVH ELOHIYM of      
Israel, there is no ELOHIYM like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath,    
who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all 
their heart:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>
Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him: thou   
spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is    
this day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Therefore now, YHVH ELOHIYM of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father    
that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight   
to sit on the throne of Israel; so that thy children take heed to their way,    
that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And now, O ELOHIYM of Israel, let 
thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David   
my father.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>  
But will ELOHIYM indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of    
heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded?</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Yet have thou   
respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O YHVH my      
ELOHIYM, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth   
before thee to day:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD>
<TD><P>That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward 
the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that thou mayest     
hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And hearken thou to  
the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray 
toward this place: and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou    
hearest, forgive.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>If any man trespass against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him   
to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house:</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>Then hear thou  
in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his  
way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his   
righteousness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have   
sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and    
pray, and make supplication unto thee in this house:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>Then hear thou in heaven, and     
forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which  
thou gavest unto their fathers.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>
35</H4></TD><TD><P>When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they   
have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, 
and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>Then hear thou in heaven, and     
forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, that thou teach them 
the good way wherein they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou  
hast given to thy people for an inheritance.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>If there be in the land famine, if there be     
pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpillar; if their      
enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever   
sickness there be;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>What prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy    
people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and      
spread forth his hands toward this house:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place,    
and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart   
thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children 
of men;)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>    
That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou      
gavest unto our fathers.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel,   
but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>(For they shall hear of thy great 
name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come 
and pray toward this house;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>    
43</H4></TD><TD><P>Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to  
all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may     
know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people Israel; and that they may know    
that this house, which I have builded, is called by thy name.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>If thy people go out to       
battle against their enemy, whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray  
unto YHVH toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house that I   
have built for thy name:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45><H4>45</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and   
maintain their cause.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46><H4>46</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,)   
and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry  
them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near;</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>47</H4></TD><TD><P>Yet if they shall bethink     
themselves in the land whither they were carried captives, and repent, and make 
supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying,  
We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V48><H4>48</H4></TD><TD><P>And so return unto   
thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their        
enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto thee toward their land,     
which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the  
house which I have built for thy name:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V49><H4>49</H4></TD><TD><P>Then hear thou their prayer and their           
supplication in heaven thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause,</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V50><H4>50</H4></TD><TD><P>And forgive thy      
people that have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein they 
have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before them who        
carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V51><H4>51</H4></TD><TD><P>For they be thy people, and   
thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of  
the furnace of iron:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V52><H4>52</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant,   
and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all     
that they call for unto thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V53><H4>  
53</H4></TD><TD><P>For thou didst separate them from among all the people of    
the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy    
servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O ADONAY YHVH.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V54><H4>54</H4></TD><TD><P>And it was so, that  
when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto   
YHVH, he arose from before the altar of YHVH, from kneeling on his knees with   
his hands spread up to heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V55><H4> 
55</H4></TD><TD><P>And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel     
with a loud voice, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V56><H4>     
56</H4></TD><TD><P>Blessed be YHVH, that hath given rest unto his people        
Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of    
all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V57><H4>57</H4></TD><TD><P>YHVH our        
ELOHIYM be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor       
forsake us:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V58><H4>58</H4></TD><TD><P> 
That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep   
his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our   
fathers.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V59><H4>59</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before YHVH, be nigh     
unto YHVH our ELOHIYM day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, 
and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall            
require:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V60><H4>60</H4></TD><TD><P>    
That all the people of the earth may know that YHVH is ELOHIYM, and that there  
is none else.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V61><H4>61</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Let your heart therefore be perfect with YHVH our ELOHIYM, to walk in his    
statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V62><H4>62</H4></TD><TD><P>And the king, and all Israel with 
him, offered sacrifice before YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V63>
<H4>63</H4></TD><TD><P>And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings,      
which he offered unto YHVH, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and    
twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the 
house of YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V64><H4>64</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the 
house of YHVH: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and    
the fat of the peace offerings: because the brazen altar that was before YHVH   
was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat  
of the peace offerings.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V65><H4>65</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a   
great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt,     
before YHVH our ELOHIYM, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V66><H4>66</H4></TD><TD><P>On the eighth day he 
sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents      
joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that YHVH had done for David his  
servant, and for Israel his people.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
