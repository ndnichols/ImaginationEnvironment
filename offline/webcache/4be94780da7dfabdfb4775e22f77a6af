For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the ELYOWN EL, who met Abraham   
returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>To whom also Abraham gave a     
tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and     
after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Without father, without mother,     
without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made    
like unto the Son of ELOHIYM; abideth a priest continually.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Now consider how great this man 
was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And verily they that   
are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a       
commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of      
their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>But he whose descent is not     
counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the      
promises.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And here men that die receive   
tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And as I may so   
say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>For he was yet in the loins   
of his father, when Melchisedec met him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical   
priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was   
there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not   
be called after the order of Aaron?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12>
<H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>For the priesthood being changed, there is made of       
necessity a change also of the law.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13>
<H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to     
another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>For it is evident that our    
ADONAY sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning        
priesthood.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec    
there ariseth another priest,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>  
16</H4></TD><TD><P>Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but  
after the power of an endless life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17>
<H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the  
order of Melchisedec.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before  
for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>For the law made nothing perfect, but the    
bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto ELOHIYM.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And inasmuch as 
not without an oath he was made priest:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>(For those priests were made without an oath;   
but this with an oath by him that said unto him, YHVH sware and will not        
repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>By so much was       
YAHSHUA made a surety of a better testament.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And they truly were many priests, because they  
were not suffered to continue by reason of death:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>But this man, because he          
continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore he is able also to save 
them to the uttermost that come unto ELOHIYM by him, seeing he ever liveth to   
make intercession for them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>    
26</H4></TD><TD><P>For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless,    
undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>Who needeth not      
daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins,    
and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>For the law     
maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which   
was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.</P></TD>
