of Edom into lime:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD>

Kirioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of   
the trumpet:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the      
princes thereof with him, saith YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

Judah, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they

lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked:</P></TD>
