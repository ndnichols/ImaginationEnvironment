1</H4></TD><TD><P>Paul, a servant of YAHSHUA MASHIYACH, called to be an         
apostle, separated unto the gospel of ELOHIYM,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>(Which he had promised afore by his prophets   
in the holy scriptures,)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>Concerning his Son YAHSHUA MASHIYACH our ADONAY, which was made of  
the seed of David according to the flesh;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And declared to be the Son of ELOHIYM with power, 
according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>By whom we have        
received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations,   
for his name:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Among whom are ye also the called of YAHSHUA MASHIYACH:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>To all that be in Rome, beloved of  
ELOHIYM, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from EL our Father, and    
the ADONAY YAHSHUA MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>   
8</H4></TD><TD><P>First, I thank my EL through YAHSHUA MASHIYACH for you all,   
that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>For ELOHIYM is my witness, whom I   
serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make      
mention of you always in my prayers;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Making request, if by any means now at length I 
might have a prosperous journey by the will of ELOHIYM to come unto you.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>For I long to   
see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be   
established;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>
That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of  
you and me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come 
unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also,  
even as among other Gentiles.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>  
14</H4></TD><TD><P>I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both  
to the wise, and to the unwise.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>
15</H4></TD><TD><P>So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to  
you that are at Rome also.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>     
16</H4></TD><TD><P>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of MASHIYACH: for it is   
the power of ELOHIYM unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew     
first, and also to the Greek.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>  
17</H4></TD><TD><P>For therein is the righteousness of ELOHIYM revealed from    
faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>For the wrath of ELOHIYM  
is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who 
hold the truth in unrighteousness;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19> 
<H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Because that which may be known of ELOHIYM is manifest   
in them; for EL hath shewed it unto them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>For the invisible things of him from the        
creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are 
made, even his eternal power and divinity; so that they are without excuse:</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Because that,   
when they knew ELOHIYM, they glorified him not as EL, neither were thankful;    
but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Professing      
themselves to be wise, they became fools,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And changed the glory of the uncorruptible      
ELOHIYM into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and           
fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore ELOHIYM also gave them up to          
uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own       
bodies between themselves:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>     
25</H4></TD><TD><P>Who changed the truth of ELOHIYM into a lie, and worshipped  
and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever.         
Amen.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>For    
this cause ELOHIYM gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did  
change the natural use into that which is against nature:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And likewise also the men,        
leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another;  
men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that   
recompence of their error which was meet.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And even as they did not like to retain ELOHIYM 
in their knowledge, EL gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things   
which are not convenient;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>      
29</H4></TD><TD><P>Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication,          
wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit,  
malignity; whisperers,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>Backbiters, haters of ELOHIYM, despiteful, proud, boasters,         
inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>Without understanding,            
covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>Who knowing the      
judgment of ELOHIYM, that they which commit such things are worthy of death,    
not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.</P></TD></TR>
