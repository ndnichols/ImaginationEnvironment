do all the words of this law:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>

approach that thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the         
tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and     
Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH

will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.</P></TD>

shall befall them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come  
upon us, because our ELOHIYM is not among us?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will surely hide my face in that day

other gods.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel:  
put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the      
children of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD>
<TD><P>For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto      
their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and  
filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and      
serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And it shall come to pass, when   
many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall testify against 
them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their     
seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have 
brought them into the land which I sware.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Moses therefore wrote this song the same day,

Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, 
when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until    
they were finished,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD>
<TD><P>That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of  
YHVH, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant 
of YHVH your ELOHIYM, that it may be there for a witness against thee.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>For I know thy       
rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day,  
ye have been rebellious against YHVH; and how much more after my death?</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Gather unto me all   
the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in   
their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>For I know that after my      
death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I   
have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye     
will do evil in the sight of YHVH, to provoke him to anger through the work of  
your hands.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this 
song, until they were ended.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
