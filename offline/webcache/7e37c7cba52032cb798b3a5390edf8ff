<p>1. THE Kine have come and brought good fortune: let them rest in the cow-pen and be happy near us.<br> Here let them stay prolific, many-coloured, and yield through many morns their milk for Indra.<br> 2 Indra aids him who offers sacrifice and gifts: he takes not what is his, and gives him more thereto.<br> Increasing ever more and ever more his wealth, he makes the pious dwell within unbroken bounds.<br> 3 These are ne&#146;er lost, no robber ever injures them: no evil-minded foe attempts to harass them.<br> The master of the Kine lives many a year with these, the Cows whereby he pours his gifts and serves the Gods.<br> 4 The charger with his dusty brow o&#146;ertakes them not, and never to the shambles do they take their way.<br> These Cows, the cattle of the pious worshipper, roam over widespread pasture where no danger is.<br> 5 To me the Cows seem Bhaga, they seem Indra, they seem a portion of the first-poured Soma.<br> These present Cows, they, O ye Indra. I long for Indra with my heart and spirit.<br> 6 O Cows, ye fatten e&#146;en the worn and wasted, and make the unlovely beautiful tolook on.<br> Prosper my house, ye with auspicious voices. Your power is glorified in our assemblies.<br> 7 Crop goodly pasturage and be prolific drink pure sweet water at good drinking places.<br> Never be thief or sinful man your matter, and may the dart of Rudra still avoid you.<br> 8 Now let this close admixture be close intermigled with these Cows,<br> Mixt with the Steer's prolific flow, and, Indra, with thy hero might.</p>
