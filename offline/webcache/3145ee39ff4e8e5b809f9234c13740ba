</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover,         
brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also   
ye have received, and wherein ye stand;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory  
what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>For I delivered unto you first of   
all that which I also received, how that MASHIYACH died for our sins according  
to the scriptures;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according   
to the scriptures:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>After that, he was seen of above    
five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this        
present, but some are fallen asleep.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7>
<H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>After that, he was seen of James; then of all the         
apostles.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>For I am the least of  
the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted    
the church of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>But by the grace of ELOHIYM I am what I am: and his grace which was 
bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: 
yet not I, but the grace of ELOHIYM which was with me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore whether it were I or    
they, so we preach, and so ye believed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Now if MASHIYACH be preached that he rose from  
the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>But if there be 
no resurrection of the dead, then is MASHIYACH not risen:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And if MASHIYACH be not risen,    
then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Yea, and we are found false       
witnesses of ELOHIYM; because we have testified of EL that he raised up         
MASHIYACH: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>For if the dead rise not, 
then is not MASHIYACH raised:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>  
17</H4></TD><TD><P>And if MASHIYACH be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are   
yet in your sins.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Then they also which are fallen asleep in MASHIYACH are perished.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>If in this life 
only we have hope in MASHIYACH, we are of all men most miserable.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>But now is MASHIYACH      
risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>For since by man     
came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>For as in Adam all die, even so   
in MASHIYACH shall all be made alive.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>But every man in his own order: MASHIYACH the   
firstfruits; afterward they that are MASHIYACH's at his coming.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Then cometh the end, when 
he shall have delivered up the kingdom to ELOHIYM, even the Father; when he     
shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>For he must reign, till he hath   
put all enemies under his feet.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>
26</H4></TD><TD><P>The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>For he hath put all  
things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is    
manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And when all things shall 
be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that   
put all things under him, that ELOHIYM may be all in all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Else what shall they do which are 
baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized  
for the dead?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>I protest by your rejoicing which I have in     
MASHIYACH YAHSHUA our ADONAY, I die daily.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>If after the manner of men I have fought with   
beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and 
drink; for to morrow we die.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>   
33</H4></TD><TD><P>Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good            
manners.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of         
ELOHIYM: I speak this to your shame.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>But some man will say, How are the dead raised  
up? and with what body do they come?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not        
quickened, except it die:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>      
37</H4></TD><TD><P>And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that   
shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>But ELOHIYM     
giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>All flesh is    
not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of     
beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>There are also celestial bodies,  
and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of 
the terrestrial is another.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>    
41</H4></TD><TD><P>There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the      
moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star  
in glory.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>So 
also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in 
incorruption:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it   
is raised in power:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD>
<TD><P>It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a     
natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P>And so it is written, The first man Adam was    
made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46><H4>46</H4></TD><TD><P>Howbeit that was not      
first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which   
is spiritual.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>47</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the ADONAY from     
heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V48><H4>48</H4></TD><TD><P>As   
is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such 
are they also that are heavenly.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V49>   
<H4>49</H4></TD><TD><P>And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall   
also bear the image of the heavenly.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V50><H4>50</H4></TD><TD><P>Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood  
cannot inherit the kingdom of EL; neither doth corruption inherit               
incorruption.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V51><H4>51</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be    
changed,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V52><H4>52</H4></TD><TD><P>In  
a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall  
sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V53><H4>53</H4></TD><TD><P>For this        
corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on               
immortality.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V54><H4>54</H4></TD><TD><P>
So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall  
have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is       
written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V55><H4>55</H4></TD><TD><P>O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is  
thy victory?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V56><H4>56</H4></TD><TD><P>
The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V57><H4>57</H4></TD><TD><P>But thanks be to ELOHIYM,     
which giveth us the victory through our ADONAY YAHSHUA MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V58><H4>58</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore, my beloved     
brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the       
ADONAY, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the ADONAY.</P>
