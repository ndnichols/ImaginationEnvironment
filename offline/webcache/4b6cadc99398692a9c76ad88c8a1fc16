Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to         
Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And Paul, as his manner was, went   
in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the              
scriptures,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Opening and alleging, that MASHIYACH must needs have suffered, and risen again  
from the dead; and that this YAHSHUA, whom I preach unto you, is MASHIYACH.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And some of them  
believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great   
multitude, and of the chief women not a few.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, 
took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company,  
and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought 
to bring them out to the people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>
6</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain     
brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world  
upside down are come hither also;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7>   
<H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to    
the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one YAHSHUA.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And they troubled the  
people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they had taken     
security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And the brethren immediately sent 
away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming thither went into the       
synagogue of the Jews.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they      
received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures       
daily, whether those things were so.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore many of them believed; also of        
honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>But when the Jews of Thessalonica 
had knowledge that the word of ELOHIYM was preached of Paul at Berea, they came 
thither also, and stirred up the people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And then immediately the brethren sent away     
Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And they that   
conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas  
and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Now while Paul waited for 
them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly      
given to idolatry.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the       
devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Then certain         
philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some   
said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth   
of strange gods: because he preached unto them YAHSHUA, and the                 
resurrection.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what  
this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>For thou bringest certain strange things to  
our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>(For all the Athenians and        
strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to      
tell, or to hear some new thing.)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22>  
<H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye 
men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>For as I passed by,  
and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE       
UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>ELOHIYM that    
made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is YHVH of heaven and     
earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as   
though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all   
things;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the   
earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their  
habitation;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P> 
That they should seek YHVH, if haply they might feel after him, and find him,   
though he be not far from every one of us:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>For in him we live, and move, and have our      
being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his         
offspring.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of ELOHIYM, we ought not to think that   
the divinity is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's    
device.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
the times of this ignorance ELOHIYM winked at; but now commandeth all men every 
where to repent:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in 
righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given          
assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they heard of    
the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee   
again of this matter.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>So Paul departed from among them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and      
believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named       
Damaris, and others with them.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
