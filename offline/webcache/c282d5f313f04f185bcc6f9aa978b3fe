1</H4></TD><TD><P>Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the  
evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no     
pleasure in them;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD>
<P>While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor 
the clouds return after the rain:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3>   
<H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble,   
and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they    
are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened,</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And the doors shall be shut in  
the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the 
voice of the bird, and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low;</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Also when they    
shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the   
almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire   
shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the   
streets:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Or    
ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be 
broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Then shall the dust return to   
the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto ELOHIYM who gave it.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Vanity of         
vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he   
still taught the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, and  
set in order many proverbs.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>    
10</H4></TD><TD><P>The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that   
which was written was upright, even words of truth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>The words of the wise are as      
goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given from 
one shepherd.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is  
no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Let us hear the conclusion of the 
whole matter: Fear ELOHIYM, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole    
duty of man.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>
For ELOHIYM shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing,      
whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This
