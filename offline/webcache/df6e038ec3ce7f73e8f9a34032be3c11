<p>1. To you I come with this mine adoration, and with a hymn I crave the Strong Ones' favour<br> A hymn that truly makes you joyful, Maruts. Suppress your anger and unyoke your horses.<br> 2 Maruts, to you this laud with prayer and worship, formed in the mind and heart, ye Gods, is offered.<br> Come ye to us, rejoicing in your spirit, for ye are they who make our prayer effective.<br> 3 The Maruts, praised by us, shall show us favour; Maghavan, lauded, shall be most propitious.<br> Maruts,, may all our days that are to follow be very pleasant, lovely and triumphant.<br> 4 I fled in <A HREF="errata.htm#6">terror</A> from this mighty Indra, my body trembling in alarm, O Maruts.<br> Oblations meant for you had been made ready; these have we set aside: for this forgive us.<br> 5 By whom the M&#257;nas recognize the day-springs, by whose strength at the dawn of endless mornings,<br> Give us, thou Mighty, glory with Maruts. fierce with the fierce, the Strong who givest triumph.<br> 6 Do thou, O Indra, guard the conquering Heroes, and rid thee of thy wrath against the Maruts,<br> With them, the wise, victorious and bestowing. May we find strengthening food in full abundance.</p>
