<p>1. HERE is the Soma juice expressed; O Vasu, drink till thou art full:<br> Undaunted God, we give it thee.<br> 2 Washed by the men, pressed out with stones, strained through the filter made of wool,<br> &#146;Tis like a courser bathed in stream.<br> 3 This juice have we made sweet for thee like barley, blending it with milk.<br> Indra, I call thee to our feast.<br> 4 Beloved of all, Indra alone drinks up the flowing Soma juice<br> Among the Gods and mortal men.<br> 5 The Friend, whom not the brilliant-hued, the badly-mixt or bitter draught,<br> Repels, the far-extending God;<br> 6 While other men than we with milk chase him as hunters chase a deer,<br> And with their kine inveigle him.<br> 7 For him, for Indra, for the God, be pressed three draughts of Soma juice<br> In the juice-drinker's own abode.<br> 8 Three reservoirs exude their drops, filled are three beakers to the brim,<br> All for one offering to the God.<br> 9 Pure art thou, set in many a place, and blended in the midst with milk<br> And curd, to cheer the Hero best.<br> 10 Here, Indra, are thy Soma-draughts pressed out by us, the strong, the pure:<br> They crave admixture of the milk.<br> 11 O Indra, pour in milk, prepare the cake, and mix the Soma-draught.<br> I hear them say that thou art rich.<br> 12 Quaffed juices fight within the breast. The drunken praise not by their wine,<br> The naked praise not when it rains.<br> 13 Rich be the praiser of one rich, munificent and famed like thee:<br> High rank be his, O Lord of Bays.<br> 14 Foe of the man who adds no milk, he heeds not any chanted hymn<br> Or holy psalm that may he sung.<br> 15 Give us not, Indra, as a prey unto the scornful or the proud:<br> Help, Mighty One, with power and might.<br> 16 This, even this, O Indra, we implore. as thy devoted friends,<br> The Ka&#7751;vas praise thee with their hymns.<br> 17 Naught else, O Thunderer, have I praised in the skilled singer's eulogy:<br> On thy land only have I thought.<br> 18 The Gods seek him who presses out the Soma; they desire not sleep<br> They punish sloth unweariedly.<br> 19 Come hither swift with gifts of wealth - be not thou angry with us-like<br> A great man with a youthful bride.<br> 20 Let him not, wrathful with us, spend the evening far from us to-day,<br> Like some unpleasant son-in-law.<br> 21 For well we know this Hero's love, most liberal of the boons he gives,<br> His plans whom the three worlds display.<br> 22 Pour forth the gift which Ka&#7751;vas bring, for none more glorious do we know<br> Than the Strong Lord with countless aids.<br> 23 O presser, offer Soma first to Indra, Hero, &#346;akra, him<br> The Friend of man, that he may drink;<br> 24 Who, in untroubled ways, is best provider, for his worshippers.<br> Of strength in horses and in kine.<br> 25 Pressers, for him blend Soma juice, each draught most excellent, for him<br> The Brave, the Hero, for his joy.<br> 26 The V&#7771;tra-slayer drinks the juice. May he who gives a hundred aids<br> Approach, nor stay afar from us.<br> 27 May the strong Bay Steeds, yoked by prayer, bring hither unto us our Friend,<br> Lover of Song, renowned by songs.<br> 28 Sweet are the Soma juices, come! Blent are the Soma juices, come!<br> &#7770;&#7779;i-like, mighty, fair of cheek, come hither quickly to the feast.<br> 29 And lauds which strengthen thee for great bounty and valour, and exalt<br> Indra who doeth glorious deeds,<br> 30 And songs to thee who lovest song, and all those hymns addressed to thee-<br> These evermore confirm thy might.<br> 31 Thus he, sole doer of great deeds whose hand holds thunder, gives us strength,<br> He who hath never been subdued.<br> 32 V&#7771;tra he slays with his right hand, even Indra, great with mighty power,<br> And much-invoked in many a place.<br> 33 He upon whom all men depend, all regions, all achievements, he<br> Takes pleasure in our wealthy chiefs.<br> 34 All this hath he accomplished, yea, Indra, most gloriously renowned,<br> Who gives our wealthy princes strength.<br> 35 Who drives his chariot seeking spoil, from afar, to him he loves:<br> For swift is he to bring men wealth.<br> 36 The Sage who, winning spoil with steeds, slays V&#7771;tra, Hero with the men,<br> His servant's faithful succourer.<br> 37 O Priyamedhas, worship with collected mind this Indra whom<br> The Soma hath full well inspired.<br> 38 Ye Ka&#7751;vas, sing the Mighty One, Lord of the Brave, who loves renown,<br> All-present, glorified by song.<br> 39 Strong Friend, who, with no trace of feet, restores the cattle to the men,<br> Who rest their wish and hope on him.<br> 40 Shaped as a Ram, Stone-hurler I once thou camest hither to the son<br> Of Ka&#7751;va, wise Medhy&#257;tithi.<br> 41 Vibhindu, thou hast helped this man, giving him thousands four times ten,<br> And afterward eight thousand more.<br> 42 And these twain pouring streams of milk, creative, daughters of delight,<br> For wedlock sake I glorify.</p>
