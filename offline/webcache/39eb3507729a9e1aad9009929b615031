<p>1. As sits the young bird on the tree rejoicing, ye, swift Pair, have been roused by clear laudation,<br> Whose Herald-Priest through many days is Indra, earth's Guardian, Friend of men, the best of Heroes.<br> 2 May we, when this Dawn and the next dance hither, be thy best servants, most heroic Hero!<br> Let the victorious car with triple splendour bring hitherward the hundred chiefs with Kutsa.<br> 3 What was the gladdening draught that pleased thee, Indra? Speed through our doors to songs, for thou art mighty.<br> Why comest thou to me, what gift attracts thee? Fain would I bring thee food most meet to offer.<br> 4 Indra, what fame hath one like thee mid heroes? With what plan wilt thou act? Why hast thou sought us?<br> As a true Friend, Wide-Strider! to sustain us, since food absorbs the thought of each among us.<br> 5 Speed happily those, as S&#363;rya ends his journey, who meet his wish as bridegrooms meet their spouses;<br> Men who present, O Indra strong by nature, with food the many songs that tell thy praises.<br> 6 Thine are two measures, Indra, wide-wellmeted, heaven for thy majesty, earth for thy wisdom.<br> Here for thy choice are Somas mixed with butter: may the sweet meath be pleasant for thy drinking.<br> 7 They have poured out a bowl to him, to Indra, full of sweet juice, for faithful is his bounty.<br> O'er earth's expanse hath he grown great by wisdom, the Friend of man, and by heroic exploits.<br> 8 Indra hath conquered in his wars, the Mighty: men strive in multitudes to win his friendship.<br> Ascend thy chariot as it were in battle, which thou shalt drive to us with gracious favour.</p>
