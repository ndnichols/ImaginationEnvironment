<p>1. THEY cleanse the Gold-hued: like a red Steed is he yoked, and Soma in the jar is mingled with the milk.<br> He sendeth out his voice, and many loving friends of him the highly lauded hasten with their songs.<br> 2 The many sages utter words in unison, while into Indra's throat they pour the Soma juice,<br> When, with the ten that dwell together closely joined, the men whose hands are skilful cleanse the lovely meath.<br> 3 He goes upon his way, unresting, to the cows, over the roaring sound which Sarya's Daughter loves.<br> The Falcon brought it to him for his own delight: now with the twofold kindred sisters is his home.<br> 4 Washed by the men, stone-pressed, dear on the holy grass, faithful to seasons, Lord of cattle from of old,<br> Most liberal, completing sacrifice for men, O Indra, pure bright Soma, Indu, flows for thee.<br> 5 O Indra, urged by arms of men and poured in streams, Soma flows on for thee after&#7717;is Godlike kind.<br> Plans thou fulfillest, gatherest thoughts for sacrifice: in the bowls sits the Gold-hued like a roosting bird.<br> 6 Sages well-skilled in work, intelligent, drain out the stalk that roars, the Sage, the Everlasting One.<br> The milk, the hymns unite them with him in the place of sacrifice, his seat who is produced anew.<br> 7 Earth's central point, sustainer of the mighty heavens, distilled into the streams, into the waters' wave,<br> As Indra's thunderbolt, Steer with farspreading wealth, Soma is flowing on to make the heart rejoice.<br> 8 Over the earthly region flow thou on thy way, helping the praiser and the pourer, thou Most Wise.<br> Let us not lack rich treasure reaching to our home, and may we clothe ourselves in manifold bright wealth.<br> 9 Hither, O Indu, unto us a hundred gifts of steeds, a thousand gifts of cattle and of gold,<br> Measure thou forth, yea, splendid ample strengthening food do thou, O Pavamana, heed this laud of ours.</p>
