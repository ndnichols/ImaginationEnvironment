common among men:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD>
<P>A man to whom ELOHIYM hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he      
wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet ELOHIYM giveth him    
not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this is vanity, and it is   
an evil disease.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, so that the days of 
his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good, and also that he have  
no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is better than he.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>For he cometh in with vanity,   
and departeth in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover he hath not   
seen the sun, nor known any thing: this hath more rest than the other.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Yea, though he live a  
thousand years twice told, yet hath he seen no good: do not all go to one       
place?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>All the 
labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>For what hath the wise 
more than the fool? what hath the poor, that knoweth to walk before the         
living?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Better 
is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this is also vanity  
and vexation of spirit.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it is   
man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Seeing there be many things   
that increase vanity, what is man the better?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>For who knoweth what is good for man in this 
life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can  
tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This
