they may serve me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD>

YHVH is upon thy cattle which is in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses,

grievous murrain.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And YHVH shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt:   
and there shall nothing die of all that is the children's of Israel.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH appointed a

</TD><TD><P>And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of   
the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let  
the people go.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>
And YHVH said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the   
furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of            
Pharaoh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil

Egypt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled

<P>And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the 
boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH hardened the heart of    
Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as YHVH had spoken unto Moses.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH said unto   
Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto     
him, Thus saith YHVH ELOHIYM of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may    
serve me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>   
For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy      
servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me 
in all the earth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people 
with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And in very deed for this cause   
have I raised thee up, for to show in thee my power; and that my name may be    
declared throughout all the earth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17> 
<H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that     
thou wilt not let them go?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>     
18</H4></TD><TD><P>Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a  
very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof 
even until now.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD>
<P>Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the     
field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and      
shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall   
die.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>He that 
feared the word of YHVH among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his 
cattle flee into the houses:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>   
21</H4></TD><TD><P>And he that regarded not the word of YHVH left his servants  
and his cattle in the field.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>   
22</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward    
heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon     
beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses stretched  
forth his rod toward heaven: and YHVH sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran   
along upon the ground; and YHVH rained hail upon the land of Egypt.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>So there was hail,   
and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it   
in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And the hail smote throughout all 
the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail   
smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>Only in the land of       
Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And Pharaoh sent, and called  
for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: YHVH is       
righteous, and I and my people are wicked.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Entreat YHVH (for it is enough) that there be   
no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay   
no longer.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread    
abroad my hands unto YHVH; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be  
any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth is YHVH's.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>But as for thee and thy   
servants, I know that ye will not yet fear YHVH ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And the flax and the barley was   
smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>But the wheat and the rye 
were not smitten: for they were not grown up.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, 
and spread abroad his hands unto YHVH: and the thunders and hail ceased, and    
the rain was not poured upon the earth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail 
and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he    
and his servants.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children 
of Israel go; as YHVH had spoken by Moses.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This
