<p>1 WHATEVER law of thine, O God, O Varu&#7751;a, as we are men,<br> Day after day we violate.<br> 2 give us not as a prey to death, to be destroyed by thee in wrath,<br> To thy fierce anger when displeased.<br> 3 To gain thy mercy, Varu&#7751;a, with hymns we bind thy heart, as binds<br> The charioteer his tethered horse.<br> 4 They flee from me dispirited, bent only on obtaining wealth,<br> As to their nests the birds of air.<br> 5 When shall we bring, to be appeased, the Hero, Lord of warrior might,<br> Him, the far-seeing Varu&#7751;a?<br> 6 This, this with joy they both accept in common: never do they fail<br> The ever-faithful worshipper.<br> 7 He knows the path of birds that fly through heaven, and, Sovran of the sea,<br> He knows the ships that are thereon.<br> 8 True to his holy law, he knows the twelve moons with their progeny:<br> He knows the moon of later birth.<br> 9 He knows the pathway of the wind, the spreading, high, and mighty wind:<br> He knows the Gods who dwell above.<br> 10 Varu&#7751;a, true to holy law, sits down among his people; he,<br> Most wise, sits there to govern all.<br> 11 From thence <A HREF="errata.htm#1">perceiving</A> he beholds all wondrous things, both what hath been,<br> And what hereafter will be done.<br> 12 May that &#256;ditya, very wise, make fair paths for us all our days:<br> May he prolong our lives for us.<br> 13 Varu&#7751;a, wearing golden mail, hath clad him in a shining robe.<br> His spies are seated found about.<br> 14 The God whom enemies threaten not, nor those who tyrannize o&#146;er men,<br> Nor those whose minds are bent on wrong.<br> 15 He who gives glory to mankind, not glory that is incomplete,<br> To our own bodies giving it.<br> 16 Yearning for the wide-seeing One, my thoughts move onward unto him,<br> As kine unto their pastures move.<br> 17 Once more together let us speak, because my meath is brought: priest-like<br> Thou eatest what is dear to thee.<br> 18 Now saw I him whom all may see, I saw his car above the earth:<br> He hath accepted these my songs.<br> 19 Varu&#7751;a, hear this call of mine: be gracious unto us this day<br> Longing for help I cried to thee.<br> 20 Thou, O wise God, art Lord of all, thou art the King of earth and heaven<br> Hear, as thou goest on thy way.<br> 21 Release us from the upper bond, untie the bond between, and loose<br> The bonds below, that I may live.</p>
