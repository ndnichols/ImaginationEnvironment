<p>1 WHAT now? When will ye take us by both hands, as a dear sire his son,<br> Gods, for whom sacred grass is clipped?<br> 2 Now whither? To what goal of yours go ye in heaven, and not on earth?<br> Where do your cows disport themselves?<br> 3 Where are your newest favours shown? Where, Maruts, your prosperity?<br> Where all your high felicities?<br> 4 If, O ye Maruts, ye the Sons whom P&#7771;&#347;ni bore, were mortal, and<br> Immortal he who sings your praise.<br> 5 Then never were your praiser loathed like a wild beast in pasture-land,<br> Nor should he go on Yama's path.<br> 6 Let not destructive plague on plague hard to be conquered, strike its down:<br> Let each, with drought, depart from us.<br> 7 Truly, they the fierce and mighty Sons of Rudra send their windless<br> Rain e&#146;en on the desert places.<br> 8 Like a cow the lightning lows and follows, motherlike, her youngling,<br> When their rain-flood hath been loosened.<br> 9 When they inundate the earth they spread forth darkness e&#146;en in day time,<br> With the water-laden rain-cloud.<br> 10 O Maruts, at your voice's sound this earthly habitation shakes,<br> And each man reels who dwells therein.<br> 11 O Maruts, with your strong-hoofed steeds, unhindered in their courses, haste<br> Along the bright embanked streams.<br> 12 Firm be the fellies of your wheels, steady your horses and your cars,<br> And may your reins be fashioned well.<br> 13 Invite thou hither with this song, for praise, Agni the Lord of Prayer,<br> Him who is fair as Mitra is.<br> 14 Form in thy mouth the hymn of praise expand thee like, a rainy cloud<br> Sing forth the measured eulogy.<br> 15 Sing glory to the Marut host, praiseworthy, tuneful, vigorous:<br> Here let the Strong Ones dwell with us.</p>
