<p>1. THE, Faithful One, Immortal among mortals, a God among the Gods, appointed envoy,<br> Priest, best at worship, must shine forth in glory . Agni shall be raised high with man's oblations.<br> 2 Born for us here this day, O Son of Vigour, between both races of born beings, Agni,<br> Thou farest as an envoy, having harnessed, Sublime One! thy strong-muscled radiant stallions.<br> 3 I laud the ruddy steeds who pour down blessing, dropping oil, flectest through the thoualit of Order.<br> Yoking red horses to and fro thou goest between you Deities and mortal races.<br> 4 Aryaman, Mitra, Varu&#7751;a, and Indra with Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, of the Gods, Maruts and A&#347;vins-<br> These, Agni, with good car and steeds, bring hither, most bountiful, to folk with fair oblations.<br> 5 Agni, be this our sacrifice eternal, with brave friends, rich in kine and sheep and horses,<br> Rich, Asura! in sacred food and children, in full assembly, wealth broad-based and during.<br> 6 The man who, sweating, brings for thee the fuel, and makes his head to ache, thy faithful servant,&#151;<br> Agni, to him be a self-strong Protector guard him from all who seek to do him mischief.<br> 7 Who brings thee food, though thou hast food in plenty, welcomes his cheerful guest and speeds him onward,<br> Who kindles thee devoutly in his dwelling,to him be wealth secure and freely giving.<br> 8 Whoso sings praise to thee at eve or morning, and, with oblation, doth the thing thou lovest,&#151;<br> In his own home, even as a goId-girt courser, rescue him from distress, the bounteous giver.<br> 9 Whoso brings gifts to thee Immortal, Agni, and doth thee service with uplifted ladle,&#151;<br> Let him not, sorely toiling, lose his riches; let not the sinner's wickedness enclose him.<br> 10 Whose well-wrought worship thou acceptest, Agni, thou God a mortal's gift, thou liberal Giver,&#151;<br> Dear be his sacrifice to thee, Most Youthful! and may we strengthen him when he adores thee.<br> 11 May he who knows distinguish sense and folly of men, like straight and crooked backs of horses.<br> Lead us, O God, to wealth and noble offspring: keep penury afar and grant us plenty.<br> 12 This Sage the Sages, ne&#146;er deceived, commanded, setting him down in dwellings of the living.<br> Hence mayst thou, friendly God, with rapid footsteps behold the Gods, wonderful, fair to look on.<br> 13 Good guidance hast thou for the priest, O Agni, who, Youngest God! with outpoured Soma serves thee.<br> Ruler of men, thou joyous God, bring treasure splendid and plentiful to aid the toiler.<br> 14 Now all that we, thy faithful servants, Agni, have done with feet, with hands, and with our bodies,<br> The wise, with toil, the holy rite have guided, as those who frame a car with manual cunning.<br> 15 May we, seven sages first in rank, engender, from Dawn the Mother, men to be ordainers.<br> May we, A&#7749;girases, be sons of Heaven, and, radiant, burst the wealth-containing mountain.<br> 16 As in the days of old our ancient Fathers, speeding the work of holy worship, Agni,<br> Sought pure light and devotion, singing praises; they cleft the ground and made red Dawns apparent.<br> 17 Gods, doing holy acts, devout, resplendent, smelting like ore their human generations.<br> Enkindling Agni and exalting Indra, they came encompassing the stall of cattle.<br> 18 Strong One! he marked them-and the Gods before them-like herds of cattle in a foodful pasture.<br> There they moaned forth their strong desire for mortals, to aid the True, the nearest One, the Living.<br> 19 We have worked for thee, we have laboured nobly-bright Dawns have shed their light upon our worship-<br> Adding a beauty to the perfect Agni, and the God's beauteous eye that shines for ever.<br> 20 Agni, Disposer, we have sung these praises to thee the Wise: do thou accept them gladly.<br> Blaze up on high and ever make us richer. Give us great wealth, O thou whose boons are many.</p>
