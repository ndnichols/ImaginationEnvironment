<p>1. THE righteous singer shall o&#146;ercome his enemies, and he who serves the Gods subdue the godless man.<br> The zealous man shall vanquish the invincible, the worshipper share the food of him who worships not.<br> 2 Worship, thou hero, chase the arrogant afar: put on auspicious courage for the fight with foes.<br> Prepare oblation so that thou mayst have success. we crave the favouring help of Brahma&#7751;aspati.<br> 3 He with his folk, his house, his family, his sons, gains booty for himself, and, with the heroes, wealth,<br> Who with oblation and a true believing heart serves Brahma&#7751;aspati the Father of the Gods.<br> 4 Whoso hath honoured him with offerings rich in oil, him Brahma&#7751;aspati leads forward on his way,<br> Saves him from sorrow, frees him from his enemy, and is his wonderful deliverer from woe.</p>
