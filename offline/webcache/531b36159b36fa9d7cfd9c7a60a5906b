</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>Now I Paul myself 
beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of MASHIYACH, who in presence am     
base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>But I beseech you, that I may not   
be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold    
against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>For though we walk in  
the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal,   
but mighty through ELOHIYM to the pulling down of strong holds;)</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Casting down imaginations,  
and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of ELOHIYM, and 
bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of MASHIYACH;</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And having in a        
readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Do ye look on     
things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is     
MASHIYACH's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is MASHIYACH's,   
even so are we MASHIYACH's.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>     
8</H4></TD><TD><P>For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority,     
which the ADONAY hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I 
should not be ashamed:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>For his letters, say 
they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech 
contemptible.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we  
are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>For we dare not make          
ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend            
themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing          
themselves among themselves, are not wise.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>But we will not boast of things without our     
measure, but according to the measure of the rule which ELOHIYM hath            
distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>For we stretch not ourselves      
beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far   
as to you also in preaching the gospel of MASHIYACH:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Not boasting of things without    
our measure, that is, of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith  
is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule            
abundantly,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P> 
To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another     
man's line of things made ready to our hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>But he that glorieth, let him glory in YHVH.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>For not he that 
commendeth himself is approved, but whom YHVH commendeth.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
