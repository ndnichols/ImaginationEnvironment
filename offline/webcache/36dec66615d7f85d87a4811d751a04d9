Chapter 20</H1></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the people  
in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came  
upon him with the elders,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou   
these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And he answered and said unto them, 
I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of 
men?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And they  
reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say,    
Why then believed ye him not?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>   
6</H4></TD><TD><P>But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for  
they be persuaded that John was a prophet.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And they answered, that they could not tell       
whence it was.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>
And YAHSHUA said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these     
things.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Then   
began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, 
and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And at the      
season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the    
fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And again he    
sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and 
sent him away empty.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast him  
out.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Then    
said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it  
may be they will reverence him when they see him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>But when the husbandmen saw him,  
they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill     
him, that the inheritance may be ours.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>So they cast him out of the vineyard, and       
killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>He shall come and    
destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they  
heard it, they said, Forbid.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>   
17</H4></TD><TD><P>And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is      
written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of  
the corner?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it      
shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And the chief priests and the scribes the same  
hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived 
that he had spoken this parable against them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And they watched him, and sent forth spies,  
which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, 
that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And they asked  
him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither     
acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of ELOHIYM truly:</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Is it lawful    
for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>But he perceived their craftiness, and said     
unto them, Why tempt ye me?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>    
24</H4></TD><TD><P>Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it?     
They answered and said, Caesar's.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25>  
<H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the  
things which be Caesar's, and unto ELOHIYM the things which be EL's.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And they could not   
take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and 
held their peace.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any  
resurrection; and they asked him,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28>  
<H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's        
brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother       
should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>There were therefore seven        
brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And the second took her   
to wife, and he died childless.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>
31</H4></TD><TD><P>And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also:   
and they left no children, and died.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>Last of all the woman died also.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore in the          
resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA answering     
said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>But they which  
shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the   
dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>Neither can they die any more: for they are  
equal unto the angels; and are the children of ELOHIYM, being the children of   
the resurrection.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he     
calleth YHVH the ELOHIYM of Abraham, and the ELOHIYM of Isaac, and the ELOHIYM  
of Jacob.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>   
For he is not a ELOHIYM of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto       
him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>Then    
certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>And after that they  
durst not ask him any question at all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, How say they that        
MASHIYACH is David's son?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>      
42</H4></TD><TD><P>And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, YHVH said     
unto my ADOWN, Sit thou on my right hand,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>David therefore 
calleth him ADOWN, how is he then his son?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P>Then in the audience of all the people he said  
unto his disciples,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46><H4>46</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love      
greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the      
chief rooms at feasts;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>47</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>Which devour widows' houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the  
same shall receive greater damnation.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
