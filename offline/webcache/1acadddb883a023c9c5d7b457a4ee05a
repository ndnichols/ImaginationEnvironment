Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my          
mouth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>I will  
open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Which we have heard and known,  
and our fathers have told us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>   
4</H4></TD><TD><P>We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the     
generation to come the praises of YHVH, and his strength, and his wonderful     
works that he hath done.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in     
Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to     
their children:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should  
be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>That they might set their hope  
in ELOHIYM, and not forget the works of EL, but keep his commandments:</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And might not be as    
their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not  
their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with EL.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>The children of Ephraim, being  
armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>They kept not the covenant of 
ELOHIYM, and refused to walk in his law;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And forgat his works, and his wonders that he   
had shewed them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of   
Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>   
13</H4></TD><TD><P>He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he  
made the waters to stand as an heap.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>In the daytime also he led them with a cloud,   
and all the night with a light of fire.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave  
them drink as out of the great depths.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>He brought streams also out of the rock, and    
caused waters to run down like rivers.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And they sinned yet more against him by         
provoking the ELYOWN in the wilderness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And they tempted EL in their heart by asking    
meat for their lust.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Yea, they spake against ELOHIYM; they said, Can EL furnish a table  
in the wilderness?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams   
overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore YHVH  
heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also  
came up against Israel;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>Because they believed not in ELOHIYM, and trusted not in his        
salvation:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of          
heaven,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of       
heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Man  
did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>He caused an east wind to blow in 
the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>He rained flesh also upon them as 
dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And he let it fall in the midst   
of their camp, round about their habitations.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>So they did eat, and were well filled: for   
he gave them their own desire;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4> 
30</H4></TD><TD><P>They were not estranged from their lust. But while their     
meat was yet in their mouths,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>  
31</H4></TD><TD><P>The wrath of ELOHIYM came upon them, and slew the fattest of 
them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>For all this they sinned still, and believed 
not for his wondrous works.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>    
33</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their     
years in trouble.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired  
early after EL.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And they remembered that ELOHIYM was their rock, and the ELYOWN EL their     
redeemer.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with 
their tongues.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his    
covenant.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>   
But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them    
not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his     
wrath.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>For   
he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh    
not again.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>  
How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the           
desert!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>Yea, 
they turned back and tempted EL, and limited the Holy One of Israel.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>They remembered not  
his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>How he had wrought his signs  
in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>And had turned their rivers into blood; and  
their floods, that they could not drink.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P>He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which 
devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V46><H4>46</H4></TD><TD><P>He gave also their increase unto the         
caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V47><H4>47</H4></TD><TD><P>He destroyed their vines with hail, and      
their sycomore trees with frost.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V48>   
<H4>48</H4></TD><TD><P>He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their      
flocks to hot thunderbolts.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V49><H4>    
49</H4></TD><TD><P>He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and    
indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V50><H4>50</H4></TD><TD><P>He made a way to his anger;   
he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the            
pestilence;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V51><H4>51</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the        
tabernacles of Ham:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V52><H4>52</H4></TD>
<TD><P>But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the   
wilderness like a flock.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V53><H4>53</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea     
overwhelmed their enemies.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V54><H4>     
54</H4></TD><TD><P>And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to  
this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V55><H4>55</H4></TD><TD><P>He cast out the heathen also      
before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of    
Israel to dwell in their tents.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V56><H4>
56</H4></TD><TD><P>Yet they tempted and provoked the ELYOWN ELOHIYM, and kept   
not his testimonies:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V57><H4>57</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they    
were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V58><H4>58</H4></TD><TD><P>For they provoked him to anger with their high  
places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V59><H4>59</H4></TD><TD><P>When ELOHIYM heard this, he   
was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V60><H4>60</H4></TD><TD><P>So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh,    
the tent which he placed among men;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V61>
<H4>61</H4></TD><TD><P>And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory 
into the enemy's hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V62><H4>62</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his 
inheritance.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V63><H4>63</H4></TD><TD><P>
The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to          
marriage.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V64><H4>64</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V65><H4>65</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the ADONAY      
awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of    
wine.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V66><H4>66</H4></TD><TD><P>And he 
smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V67><H4>67</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover he     
refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V68><H4>68</H4></TD><TD><P>But chose the tribe  
of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V69><H4>69</H4></TD><TD><P>And he built his sanctuary like high palaces,   
like the earth which he hath established for ever.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V70><H4>70</H4></TD><TD><P>He chose David also his servant,  
and took him from the sheepfolds:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V71>  
<H4>71</H4></TD><TD><P>From following the ewes great with young he brought him  
to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V72><H4>72</H4></TD><TD><P>So he fed them according to the   
integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.</P>
