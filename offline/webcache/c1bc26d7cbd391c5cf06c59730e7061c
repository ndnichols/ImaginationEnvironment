</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>And I, brethren,  
when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring  
unto you the testimony of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2>  
<H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>For I determined not to know any thing among you, save    
YAHSHUA MASHIYACH, and him crucified.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and  
in much trembling.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's      
wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>That your faith should not stand in 
the wisdom of men, but in the power of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are    
perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world,    
that come to nought:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>But we speak the wisdom of ELOHIYM in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, 
which EL ordained before the world unto our glory:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Which none of the princes of this   
world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the ADONAY of  
glory.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>But as  
it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the  
heart of man, the things which ELOHIYM hath prepared for them that love him.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>But ELOHIYM     
hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things,  
yea, the deep things of EL.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>    
11</H4></TD><TD><P>For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of 
man which is in him? even so the things of ELOHIYM knoweth no man, but the      
Spirit of EL.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is   
of ELOHIYM; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of EL.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Which things    
also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy 
Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>But the natural man receiveth not 
the things of the Spirit of EL: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can  
he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>But he that is spiritual judgeth  
all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>For who hath known the mind of YHVH, that he 
may instruct him? But we have the mind of MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
