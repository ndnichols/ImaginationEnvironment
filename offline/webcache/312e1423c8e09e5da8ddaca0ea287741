<p>1. SING to your Agni with each song, at every sacrifice, for strength.<br> Come, let us praise the Wise and Everlasting God, even as a well-beloved Friend,<br> 2 The Son of Strength; for is he not our gracious Lord? Let us serve him who bears our gifts.<br> In battle may he be our help and strengthener, yea, be the saviour of our lives.<br> 3 Agni, thou beamest forth with light, great Hero, never changed by time.<br> Shining, pure Agni! with a light that never fades, beam with thy fair beams brilliantly.<br> 4 Thou worshippest great Gods: bring them without delay by wisdom and thy wondrous power.<br> O Agni, make them turn hither to succour us. Give strength, and win it for thyself.<br> 5 He whom floods, stones, and trees support, the offspring of eternal Law;<br> He who when rubbed with force is brought to life by men upon the lofty height of earth;<br> 6 He who hath filled both worlds fult with his brilliant shine, who hastens with his smoke to heaven;<br> He made himself apparent through the gloom by night, the Red Bull in the darksome nights, the Red Bull in the darksome nights.<br> 7 O Agni, with thy lofty beams, with thy pure brilliancy, O God,<br> Kindled, Most Youthful One! by Bharadv&#257;ja's hand, shine on us, O pure God, with wealth, shine, Purifier! splendidly.<br> 8 Thou art the Lord of house and home of all the tribes, O Agni, of all tribes of men.<br> Guard with a hundred forts thy kindler from distress, through hundred winters, Youngest God! and those who make thy singers rich.<br> 9 Wonderful, with thy favouring help, send us thy bounties, gracious Lord.<br> Thou art the Charioteer, Agni, of earthly wealth: find rest and safety for our seed.<br> 10 With guards unfailing never negligent speed thou our children and our progeny.<br> Keep far from us, O Agni, all celestial wrath and wickedness of godless men.<br> 11 Hither, O friends, with newest song drive her who freely pours her milk;<br> Loose her who never turns away;<br> 12 Who, for the host of Maruts bright with native sheen, hath shed immortal fame like milk;<br> Whom the impetuous Maruts look upon with love, who moves in splendour on their ways.<br> 13 For Bharadv&#257;ja she poured down in days of old<br> The milch-cow yielding milk for all, and food that gives all nourishment.<br> 14 Your friend like Indra passing wise, with magic power like Varu&#7751;a.<br> Like Aryaman joy-giving, bringing plenteous food like ViSnxu for my wish, I praise,<br> 15 Bright as the host of Maruts mighty in their roar. May they bring P&#363;&#7779;an free from foes;<br> May they bring hither hundreds, thousands for our men: may they bring hidden stores to light, and make wealth easy to be found.<br> 16 Haste to me, P&#363;&#7779;an, in thine car, bright Deity: I fain would speak:<br> Most sinful is our foeman's hate.<br> 17 Tear not up by the roots the Kakambira tree: destroy thou all malignity.<br> Let them not snare by day the neck of that Celestial Bird the Sun.<br> 18 Uninjured let thy friendship be, like the smooth surface of a skin,<br> A flawless skin, containing curds, full to the mouth, containing curds.<br> 19 For thou art high above mankind, in glory equal to the Gods.<br> Therefore, O P&#363;&#7779;an, look upon us in the fight: now help us as in days of old.<br> 20 May the kind excellence of him the Kind, loud Roarers! be our guide,<br> Be it the God's, O Maruts, or a mortal man's who worships, ye impetuous Ones!<br> 21 They whose high glory in a moment like the God, the Sun, goes round the space of heaven,<br> The Maruts have obtained bright strength, a sacred name, strength that destroys the V&#7771;tras, strength V&#7771;tra-destroying excellent.<br> 22 Once, only once, the heaven was made, once only once, the earth was formed-<br> Once, only P&#7771;&#347;ni's milk was shed: no second, after this, is born.</p>
