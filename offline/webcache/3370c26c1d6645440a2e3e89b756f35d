And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in  
one place.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it     
filled all the house where they were sitting.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And there appeared unto them cloven tongues    
like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost,  
and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And there were    
dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Now when this was 
noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that   
every man heard them speak in his own language.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying 
one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And how hear we every man   
in our own tongue, wherein we were born?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the       
dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Phrygia, and    
Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of   
Rome, Jews and proselytes,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>     
11</H4></TD><TD><P>Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues    
the wonderful works of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>
12</H4></TD><TD><P>And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to   
another, What meaneth this?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>    
13</H4></TD><TD><P>Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>But Peter, standing  
up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea,  
and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my   
words:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>For   
these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the    
day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>But     
this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And it shall come to pass in the  
last days, saith YHVH, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your    
sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions,   
and your old men shall dream dreams:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will 
pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will shew wonders in    
heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of    
smoke:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>The   
sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great    
and notable day of YHVH come:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>  
21</H4></TD><TD><P>And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the  
name of YHVH shall be saved.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>   
22</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye men of Israel, hear these words; YAHSHUA of Nazareth, a   
man approved of YHVH among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which ELOHIYM 
did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Him, being delivered by the   
determinate counsel and foreknowledge of YHVH, ye have taken, and by wicked     
hands have crucified and slain:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>
24</H4></TD><TD><P>Whom YHVH hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death:  
because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>For David speaketh concerning 
him, I foresaw YHVH always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I   
should not be moved:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover    
also my flesh shall rest in hope:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27>  
<H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither     
wilt thou suffer thine CHACIYD to see corruption.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou hast made known to me the    
ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Men and brethren, let me  
freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried,  
and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that     
ELOHIYM had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins,          
according to the flesh, he would raise up MASHIYACH to sit on his throne;</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>He seeing this  
before spake of the resurrection of MASHIYACH, that his soul was not left in    
hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>This YAHSHUA hath ELOHIYM raised up, whereof we 
all are witnesses.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Therefore being by the right hand of ELOHIYM exalted, and having         
received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this,  
which ye now see and hear.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>     
34</H4></TD><TD><P>For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith     
himself, YHVH said unto my ADOWN, Sit thou on my right hand,</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>Until I make thy foes thy     
footstool.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that ELOHIYM hath made    
the same YAHSHUA, whom ye have crucified, both ADONAY and MASHIYACH.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>Now when they heard  
this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of  
the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Peter said unto them,        
Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of YAHSHUA MASHIYACH for   
the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>For the promise is   
unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as   
YHVH our ELOHIYM shall call.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>   
40</H4></TD><TD><P>And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, 
Save yourselves from this untoward generation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>Then they that gladly received his word were 
baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand      
souls.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in      
breaking of bread, and in prayers.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43> 
<H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and      
signs were done by the apostles.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44>   
<H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>And all that believed were together, and had all things  
common;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had  
need.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46><H4>46</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from   
house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>47</H4></TD><TD><P>Praising        
ELOHIYM, and having favour with all the people. And YHVH added to the church    
daily such as should be saved.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
