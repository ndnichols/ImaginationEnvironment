VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore, my brethren dearly       
beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the ADONAY, my       
dearly beloved.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in    
the ADONAY.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with  
me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellowlabourers, whose   
names are in the book of life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>  
4</H4></TD><TD><P>Rejoice in the ADONAY alway: and again I say, Rejoice.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Let your          
moderation be known unto all men. The ADONAY is at hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Be careful for nothing; but in      
every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be   
made known unto ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And the peace of ELOHIYM, which passeth all understanding, shall    
keep your hearts and minds through MASHIYACH YAHSHUA.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Finally, brethren, whatsoever       
things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just,      
whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are 
of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on    
these things.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in  
me, do: and the ELOHIYM of peace shall be with you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>But I rejoiced in the ADONAY      
greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye 
were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Not that I speak in respect of want: for I   
have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>I know both how to be     
abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed 
both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>I can do all things  
through MASHIYACH which strengtheneth me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

communicate with my affliction.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>
15</H4></TD><TD><P>Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the   
gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as       
concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and    
again unto my necessity.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to  
your account.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the   
things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice         
acceptable, wellpleasing to ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

according to his riches in glory by MASHIYACH YAHSHUA.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21>

which are with me greet you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>

household.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>  
The grace of our ADONAY YAHSHUA MASHIYACH be with you all. Amen.</P></TD></TR>
