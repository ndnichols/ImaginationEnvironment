<p>1. PRAISE of the Asura, high imperial Ruler, the Manly One in whom the folk shall triumph-<br> I laud his deeds who is as strong as Indra, and lauding celebrate the Fort-destroyer.<br> 2 Sage, Sing, Food, Light,&#151;they bring him from the mountain, the blessed Sovran of the earth and heaven.<br> I decorate with songs the mighty actions which Agni, Fort-destroyer, did aforetime.<br> 3 The foolish, faithless, rudely-speaking niggards, without belief or sacrifice or worship,&#151;<br> Far far sway hath Agni chased those Dasytis, and, in the cast, hath turned the godless westward.<br> 4 Him who brought eastward, manliest with his prowess, the Maids rejoicing in the western darkness,<br> That Agni I extol, the Lord of riches, unyielding tamer of assailing foemen.<br> 5 Him who brake down the walls with deadly weapons, and gave the Mornings to anoble Husband,<br> Young Agni, who with conquering strength subduing the tribes of Nahus made them bring their tribute.<br> 6 In whose protection all men rest by nature, desiring to enjoy his gracious favour-<br> Agni Vai&#347;v&#257;nara in his Parents, bosom hath found the choicest seat in earth and heaven.<br> 7 Vai&#347;v&#257;nara the God, at the sun's setting, hath taken to himself deep-hidden treasures:<br> Agni hath taken them from earth and heaven, from the sea under and the sea above us.</p>
