Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to 
the commandment of YHVH, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for    
the people to drink.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that  
we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye   
tempt YHVH?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, 
and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill  
us and our children and our cattle with thirst?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>

before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod,     
wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.</P></TD></TR><TR>

thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there

Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to

prevailed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>  
But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he 
sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side,
