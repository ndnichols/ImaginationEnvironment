<p>1. THIS I allow not in the earth or heaven, at sacrifice or in these holy duties.<br> May the huge mountains crush him down: degraded be Atiyaja's sacrificing patron.<br> 2 Or he who holds us in contempt, O Maruts, or seeks to blame the prayer that we are making,<br> May agonies of burning be his portion. May the sky scorch the man who hates devotion.<br> 3 Why then, O Soma, do they call thee keeper of prayer? Why then our guardian from reproaches?<br> Why then beholdest thou how men revile us? Cast thy hot dart at him who hates devotion.<br> 4 May Mornings as they spring to life, protect me, and may the Rivers as they swell preserve me.<br> My guardians be the firmly-seated mountains: the Fathers, when I call on Gods, defend me!<br> 5 Through all our days may we be healthy. minded, and look upon the Sun when he arises.<br> Grant this the Treasure-Lord of treasures, coming, observant, oftenest of Gods, with succour!<br> 6 Most near, most oft comes Indra with protection, and she Sarasvat&#299;, who swells with rivers -<br> Parjanya, bringing health with herbs, and Agni, well lauded swift to listen, like a father.<br> 7 Hear this mine invocation; come hither, O Universal Gods,<br> Be seated on this holy grass.<br> 8 To him who comes to meet you, Gods, with offerings bathed in holy oil-<br> Approach ye, one and all, to him.<br> 9 All Sons of Immortality shall listen to the songs we sing,<br> And be exceeding good to us.<br> 10 May all the Gods who strengthen Law, with &#7770;tus, listening to our call,<br> Be pleased with theit appropriate draught.<br> 11 May Indra, with the Marut host, with Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar, Mitra, Aryaman,<br> Accept the laud and these our gifts.<br> 12 O Agni, Priest, as rules ordain, offer this sacrifice of ours,<br> Remembering the Heavenly Folk.<br> 13 Listen, All-Gods, to this mine invocation, Ye who inhabit heaven, and air's midregions,<br> All ye, O Holy Ones, whose tongue is Agni, seated upon this sacred grass, be joyful.<br> 14 May the All-Gods who claim our worship hear my thought; may the two World-halves hear it, and the Waters&#146; Child.<br> Let me not utter words that ye may disregard. Closely allied with you may we rejoice in bliss.<br> 15 And those who, Mighty, with the wiles of serpents, were born on earth, in heaven, where waters gather-<br> May they vouchsafe us life of full duration. May the Gods kindly give us nights and mornings.<br> 16 At this my call, O Agni and Parjanya, help, swift to hear, my thought and our laudation.<br> One generates holy food, the other offspring, so grant us food enough with store of children.<br> 17 When holy grass is strewn and fire enkindled, with hymn and lowly homage I invite you.<br> All-Gods, to day in this our great assembly rejoice, ye Holy, in the gifts we offer.</p>
