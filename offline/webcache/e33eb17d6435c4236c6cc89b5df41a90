<p>1. O AGNI urged to strength, the men of old who loved the Law enkindled thee,<br> the Ancient, for their aid,<br> Thee very bright, and holy, nourisher of all, most excellent, the Friend and Master of the home.<br> 2 Thee, Agni, men have stablished as their guest of old, as Master of the household, thee, with hair of flame;<br> High-bannered, multiform, distributor of wealth, kind helper, good protector, drier of the floods.<br> 3 The tribes of men praise thee, Agni, who knowest well burnt offerings, the Discerner, lavishest of wealth,<br> Dwelling in secret, Blest One! visible to all, loud-roaring, skilled in worship, glorified with oil.<br> 4 Ever to thee, O Agni, as exceeding strong have we drawn nigh with songs and reverence singing hymns.<br> So be thou pleased with us, A&#7749;giras! as a God enkindled by the noble with man's goodly light.<br> 5 Thou, Agni! multiform, God who art lauded much! givest in every house subsistence as of old.<br> Thou rulest by thy might o&#146;er food of many a sort: that light of thine when blazing may not be opposed.<br> 6 The Gods, Most Youthful Agni, have made thee, inflamed, the bearer of oblations and the messenger.<br> Thee, widely-reaching, homed in sacred oil, invoked, effulgent, have they made the Eye that stirs the thought.<br> 7 Men seeking joy have lit thee worshipped from of old, O Agni, with good fuel and with sacred oil.<br> So thou, bedewed and waxing mighty by the plants, spreadest thyself abroad over the realms of earth.</p>
