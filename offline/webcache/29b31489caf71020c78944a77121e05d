<p>1. FOR thee may Indra boldly speed the car that works on either side.<br> Favour us, Much-invoked! in this most glorious fight against the raiders of our wealth.<br> 2 Loose in the wind the woman's robe was streaming what time she won a car-load worth a thousand.<br> The charioteer in fight was Mudgalani: she Indra's dart, heaped up the prize of battle.<br> 3 O Indra, cast thy bolt among assailants who would slaughter us:<br> The weapon both of D&#257;sa and of &#256;rya foe keep far away, O Maghavan.<br> 4 The bull in joy had drunk a lake of water. His shattering horn encountered an opponent.<br> Swiftly, in vigorous strength, eager for glory, he stretched his forefeet, fain to win and triumph.<br> 5 They came anear the bull; they made him thunder, made him pour rain down ere the fight was ended.<br> And Mudgala thereby won in the contest well-pastured kine in hundreds and in thousands.<br> 6 In hope of victory that bull was harnessed: Kesi the driver urged him on with shouting.<br> As he ran swiftly with the car behind him his lifted heels pressed close on Mudgalani.<br> 7 Deftly for him he stretched the car-pole forward, guided the bull thereto and firmly yoked him.<br> Indra vouchsafed the lord of cows his favour: with mighty steps the buffalo ran onward.<br> 8 Touched by the goad the shaggy beast went nobly, bound to the pole by the yoke's thong of leather.<br> Performing deeds of might for many people, he, looking on the cows, gained strength and vigour.<br> 9 Here look upon this mace, this bull's companion, now lying midway on the field of battle.<br> Therewith hath Mudgala in ordered contest won for cattle for himself, a hundred thousand.<br> 10 Far is the evil: who hath here beheld it? Hither they bring the bull whom they are yoking..<br> To this they give not either food or water. Reaching beyond the pole it gives directions.<br> 11 Like one forsaken, she hath found a husband, and teemed as if her breast were full and flowing.<br> With swiftly-racing chariot may we conquer, and rich and blessed be our gains in battle.<br> 12 Thou, Indra, art the mark whereon the eyes of all life rest, when thou,<br> A Bull who drivest with thy bull, wilt win the race together with thy weakling friend.</p>
