<p>1. THOUGH, Indra, thou art called by men from east and west, from north and south,<br> Come hither quickly with fleet steeds<br> 2 If in the effluence of heaven, rich in its light, thou takest joy,<br> Or in the sea in Soma juice.<br> 3 With songs I call thee, Great and Wide, even as a cow to profit us,<br> Indra, to drink the Soma-draught.<br> 4 Hither, O Indra, let thy Bays bear up and, bring upon thy car<br> Thy glory, God! and majesty.<br> 5 Thou, Indra, wouldst be sung and praised as great, strong, lordly in thy deeds<br> Come hither, drink our Soma juice.<br> 6 We who have shed the Soma and prepared the feast are calling thee.<br> To sit on this our sacred grass.<br> 7 As, Indra, thou art evermore the common Lord of all alike,<br> As such we invocate thee now.<br> 8 The men with stones have milked for thee this nectar of the Soma juice:<br> Indra, be pleased with it, and drink.<br> 9 Neglect all pious men with skill in sacred song: come hitherward,<br> With speed, and give us high renown.<br> 10 Gods, may the mighty rest unharmed, the King who gives me spotted kine,<br> Kine decked with golden ornaments.<br> 11 Beside a thousand spotted kine I have received a gift of gold,<br> Pure, brilliant, and exceeding great.<br> 12 Durgaha's grandsons, giving me a thousand kine, munificent,<br> Have won renown among the Gods.</p>
