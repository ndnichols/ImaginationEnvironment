<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>Furthermore David the king said 
unto all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone ELOHIYM hath chosen, is   
yet young and tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but 
for YHVH ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD>
<P>Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my ELOHIYM the gold   
for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and the     
brass for things of brass, the iron for things of iron, and wood for things of  
wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers       
colors, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover, because 
I have set my affection to the house of my ELOHIYM, I have of mine own proper   
good, of gold and silver, which I have given to the house of my ELOHIYM, over   
and above all that I have prepared for the holy house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Even three thousand talents of      
gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to    
overlay the walls of the houses withal:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>The gold for things of gold, and the silver for   
things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of         
artificers. And who then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto     
YHVH?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the 
chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel and the captains of    
thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king's work, offered          
willingly,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
gave for the service of the house of ELOHIYM of gold five thousand talents and  
ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen   
thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And they with whom precious     
stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of YHVH, by the hand   
of Jehiel the Gershonite.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because  
with perfect heart they offered willingly to YHVH: and David the king also      
rejoiced with great joy.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Wherefore David blessed YHVH before all the congregation: and David 
said, Blessed be thou, YHVH ELOHIYM of Israel our father, for ever and ever.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Thine, O YHVH   
is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the        
majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the  
kingdom, O YHVH, and thou art exalted as head above all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Both riches and honor come of     
thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in  
thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Now therefore, our ELOHIYM,   
we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>But who am I, and what is my people, that we    
should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of    
thee, and of thine own have we given thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>For we are strangers before thee, and           
sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and 
there is none abiding.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>O YHVH our ELOHIYM, all this store that we have prepared to build   
thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is all thine        
own.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>I know  
also, my ELOHIYM, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. 
As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these  
things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to     
offer willingly unto thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>     
18</H4></TD><TD><P>O YHVH ELOHIYM of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our         
fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of  
thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And give unto Solomon my son a perfect       
heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do   
all these things, and to build the palace, for the which I have made            
provision.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And David said to all the congregation, Now bless YHVH your ELOHIYM. And all    
the congregation blessed YHVH ELOHIYM of their fathers, and bowed down their    
heads, and worshipped YHVH, and the king.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And they sacrificed sacrifices unto YHVH, and   
offered burnt offerings unto YHVH, on the morrow after that day, even a         
thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink      
offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And did eat and drink before YHVH 
on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king    
the second time, and anointed him unto YHVH to be the chief governor, and Zadok 
to be priest.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Then Solomon sat on the throne of YHVH as king instead of David his father,  
and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And all the princes, and the mighty men, and    
all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the      
king.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
YHVH magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed     
upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in           
Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus 
David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And the time that he reigned over Israel was 
forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years       
reigned he in Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and 
Solomon his son reigned in his stead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of     
Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>With all his reign and his might,

the countries.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John
