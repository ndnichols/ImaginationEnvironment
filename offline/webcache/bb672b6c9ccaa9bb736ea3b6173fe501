of Egypt saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first  
month of the year to you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth  
day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the    
house of their fathers, a lamb for an house:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And if the household be too little for the lamb,  
let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of 
the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the      
lamb.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Your     
lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it out   
from the sheep, or from the goats:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6>  
<H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the   
same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it  
in the evening.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on 
the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And they shall eat the flesh in 
that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they   
shall eat it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head  
with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And ye shall let nothing of it remain until  
the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn     
with fire.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and

passover.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>   
For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the

Egypt I will execute judgment: I am YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and    
the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of       
Egypt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to YHVH

ever.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Seven  
days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven 
out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day      
until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And in the first day there

convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which    
every man must eat, that only may be done of you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

even.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Seven

VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Moses called for all the

your families, and kill the passover.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out at the door   
of his house until the morning.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>
23</H4></TD><TD><P>For YHVH will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when

over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to 
smite you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for    
ever.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And it 
shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which YHVH will give you,       
according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And it shall come to      
pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service?</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>That ye shall   
say, It is the sacrifice of YHVH's passover, who passed over the houses of the  
children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our     
houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And the children of Israel went   
away, and did as YHVH had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, that 
at midnight YHVH smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the         
firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive   
that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And Pharaoh rose up in the night, 
he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in   
Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And he called for Moses and   
Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both 
ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve YHVH, as ye have said.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>Also take your       
flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And the Egyptians    
were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in       
haste; for they said, We be all dead men.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>And the people took their dough before it was   
leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their      
shoulders.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they         
borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH gave   
the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them     
such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And the children of Israel    
journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were 
men, beside children.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and       
herds, even very much cattle.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>  
39</H4></TD><TD><P>And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they      
brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust   
out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any 
victual.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>Now 
the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred  
and thirty years.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years,     
even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of YHVH went out from 
the land of Egypt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>It is a night to be much observed unto YHVH for bringing them out from   
the land of Egypt: this is that night of YHVH to be observed of all the         
children of Israel in their generations.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the 
ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>But every man's servant   
that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat     
thereof.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P>A   
foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46><H4>46</H4></TD><TD><P>In one house shall it be eaten;   
thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither  
shall ye break a bone thereof.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4> 
47</H4></TD><TD><P>All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V48><H4>48</H4></TD><TD><P>And when a stranger shall 
sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to YHVH, let all his males be     
circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one     
that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V49><H4>49</H4></TD><TD><P>One law shall   
be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V50><H4>50</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus did all    
the children of Israel; as YHVH commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V51><H4>51</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass  
the selfsame day, that YHVH did bring the children of Israel out of the land of 
Egypt by their armies.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000
