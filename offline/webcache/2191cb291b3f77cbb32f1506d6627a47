And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had   
also received the word of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2>  
<H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were   
of the circumcision contended with him,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and 
didst eat with them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by   
order unto them, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, 
A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by 
four corners; and it came even to me:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I   
considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and        
creeping things, and fowls of the air.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; 
slay and eat.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P> 
But I said, Not so, YHVH: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time        
entered into my mouth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>But the voice answered me again from heaven, What ELOHIYM hath      
cleansed, that call not thou common.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And this was done three times: and all were     
drawn up again into heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>    
11</H4></TD><TD><P>And, behold, immediately there were three men already come   
unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And the Spirit bade me go with    
them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we      
entered into the man's house:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>  
13</H4></TD><TD><P>And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house,      
which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose     
surname is Peter;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be       
saved.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Then remembered 
I the word of the ADONAY, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water;    
but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Forasmuch then as ELOHIYM gave them the like 
gift as he did unto us, who believed on the ADONAY YAHSHUA MASHIYACH; what was  
I, that I could withstand EL?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>  
18</H4></TD><TD><P>When they heard these things, they held their peace, and     
glorified ELOHIYM, saying, Then hath EL also to the Gentiles granted repentance 
unto life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about      
Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the     
word to none but unto the Jews only.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, 
which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the   
ADONAY YAHSHUA.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And the hand of YHVH was with them: and a great number believed, and turned  
unto the ADONAY.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was  
in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as         
Antioch.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of ELOHIYM, was glad, and exhorted    
them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto YHVH.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>For he was a good man,    
and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto the     
ADONAY.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Then 
departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he had found him, he brought him    
unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves  
with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called          
MASHIYACHos-ians first in Antioch.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27> 
<H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto      
Antioch.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there 
should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days 
of Claudius Caesar.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to    
send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>Which also they did, and sent it  
to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This
