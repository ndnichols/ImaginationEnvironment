<TD><P>This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir 
up your pure minds by way of remembrance:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>That ye may be mindful of the words which were    
spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles   
of the ADONAY and Saviour:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days          
scoffers, walking after their own lusts,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And saying, Where is the promise of his coming?   
for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the    
beginning of the creation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4>
</TD><TD><P>For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of        
ELOHIYM the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in 
the water:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>But the heavens and    
the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto     
fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>But, beloved, be not ignorant   
of this one thing, that one day is with YHVH as a thousand years, and a         
thousand years as one day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4>
</TD><TD><P>YHVH is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count         
slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, 
but that all should come to repentance.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>But the day of the ADONAY will come as a thief  
in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and  
the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that    
are therein shall be burned up.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>
11</H4></TD><TD><P>Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what   
manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Looking for and 
hasting unto the coming of the day of ELOHIYM, wherein the heavens being on     
fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Nevertheless we,     
according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein         
dwelleth righteousness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be         
diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And account     
that the longsuffering of our ADONAY is salvation; even as our beloved brother  
Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>As also in all his   
epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be 
understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also   
the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye  
know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of 
the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our  
ADONAY and Saviour YAHSHUA MASHIYACH. To him be glory both now and for ever.    
Amen.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M. Hurt,
