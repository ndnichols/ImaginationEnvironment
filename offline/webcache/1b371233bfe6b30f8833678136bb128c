<TD><P>Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake,      
saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, 
thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and YHVH said to thee,  
Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>So all the elders 
of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in 
Hebron before YHVH: and they anointed David king over Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>David was thirty years old when 
he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years    
and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all     
Israel and Judah.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the           
inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away  
the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David cannot   
come in hither.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of     
David.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And     
David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the     
Jebusites, and the lame and the blind that are hated of David's soul, he shall  
be chief and captain. Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not     
come into the house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David   
built round about from Millo and inward.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And David went on, and grew great, and YHVH     
ELOHIYM of hosts was with him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4> 
11</H4></TD><TD><P>And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar   
trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And David perceived that  
YHVH had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom  
for his people Israel's sake.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>  
13</H4></TD><TD><P>And David took him more concubines and wives out of          
Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters 
born to David.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And these be the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem;        
Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and     
Japhia,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>But when the Philistines heard that they had    
anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and 
David heard of it, and went down to the hold.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>The Philistines also came and spread         
themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And David inquired of YHVH, saying, Shall I go  
up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And YHVH said     
unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine      
hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and said, YHVH hath      
broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he 
called the name of that place Baalperazim.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And there they left their images, and David and 
his men burned them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the 
valley of Rephaim.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And when David inquired of YHVH, he said, Thou shalt not go up; but      
fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry       
trees.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry   
trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall YHVH go out before   
thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And David did so, as YHVH had commanded him;    
and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.</P></TD></TR>
