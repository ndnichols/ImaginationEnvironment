<p>1. BORN like a youngling he hath clamoured in the wood, when he, the Red, the Strong, would win the light of heaven.<br> He comes with heavenly seed that makes the water swell: him for wide-spreading shelter we implore with prayer.<br> 2 A far-extended pillar that supports the sky the Soma-stalk, filled full, moves itself every way.<br> He shall bring both these great worlds while the rite proceeds: the Sage holds these who move! together and all food.<br> 3 Wide space hath he who follows Aditi's right path, and mighty, well-made food, meath blent with Soma juice;<br> He who from hence commands the rain, Steer of the kine, Leader of floods, who helps us hence, who claims our laud.<br> 4 Butter and milk are drawn from animated cloud; thence Am&#7771;ta is produced, centre of sacrifice.<br> Hini the Most Bounteous Ones, ever united, love; him as ouir Friend the Men who make all swell rain down.<br> 5 The Soma-stalk hath roared, following with the wave: he swells with sap for man the skin which Gods enjoy.<br> Upon the lap of Aditi he lays the germ, by means whereof we gain children and progeny.<br> 6 In the third region which distils a thousand streams, may the Exhaustless Ones descend with procreant power.<br> The kindred Four have been sent downward from the heavens: dropping with oil they bring Am&#7771;ta and sacred gifts.<br> 7 Soma assumes white colour when he strives to gain: the bounteous Asura knows full many a precious boon.<br> Down the steep slope, through song, he comes to sacrifice, and he will burst the water-holding cask of heaven,<br> 8 Yea, to the shining milk-anointed beaker, as to his goal, hath stepped the conquering Courser.<br> Pious-souled men have sent their giffi of cattle unto Kak&#7779;&#299;v&#257;n of the hundred winters.<br> 9 Soma, thy juice when thou art blended with the streams, flows, Pavamana, through the long wool of the sheep.<br> So, cleansed by sages. O best giver of delight, grow sweet for Indra, Pavamana! for his drink.</p>
