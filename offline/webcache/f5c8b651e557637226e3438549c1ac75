<p>1. THE rich new car hath been equipped at morning; four yokes it hath, three whips, seven reins to guide it:<br> Ten-sided, friendly to mankind, light-winner, that must be urged to speed with prayers and wishes.<br> 2 This is prepared for him the first, the second, and the third time: he is man's Priest and Herald.<br> Others get offspring of another parent he goeth, as a noble Bull, with others.<br> 3 To Indra's car the Bay Steeds have I harnessed, that new well-spoken words may bring him hither.<br> Here let not other worshippers detain thee, for among us are many holy singers.<br> 4 Indra, come hitherward with two Bay Coursers, come thou with four, with six when invocated.<br> Come thou with eight, with ten, to drink the Soma. Here is the juice, brave Warrior: do not scorn it.<br> 5 O Indra, come thou hither having harnessed thy car with twenty, thirty, forty horses.<br> Come thou with fifty well trained coursers, Indra, sixty or seventy, to drink the Soma.<br> 6 Come to us hitherward, O Indra, carried by eighty, ninety, or an hundred horses.<br> This Soma juice among the &#346;unahotras hath been poured out, in love, to glad thee, Indra.<br> 7 To this my prayer, O Indra, come thou hither: bind to thy car's pole all thy two Bay Coursers.<br> Thou art to be invoked in many places Hero, rejoice thyself in this libation.<br> 8 Ne&#146;er be my love from Indra disunited still may his liberal Milch-cow yield us treasure.<br> So may we under his supreme protection, safe in his arms, succeed in each forth-going.<br> 9 Now may that wealthy Cow Of thine, O Indra, give in return a boon to him who lauds thee.<br> Give to thy praisers: let not fortune fail us. Loud may we speak, with heroes, in assembly.</p>
