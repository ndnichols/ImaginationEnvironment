<p>1. THIS was the task. Appear promptly, ye prudent Ones. Here is the chariot drawn by strong steeds: be ye glad.<br> Heart-stirring, longed for, succourers of Vi&#347;pal&#257;, here are Heaven's Sons whose sway blesses the pious man.<br> 2 Longed for, most Indra-like, mighty, most Marut-like, most wonderful in deed, car-borne, best charioteers,<br> Bring your full chariot hither heaped with liquid sweet: thereon, ye A&#347;vins, come to him who offers gifts.<br> 3 What make ye there, ye Mighty? Wherefore linger ye with folk who, offering not, are held in high esteem?<br> Pass over them; make ye the niggard's life decay: give light unto the singer eloquent in praise.<br> 4 Crunch up on. every side the dogs who bark at us: slay ye our foes, O A&#347;vins this ye understand.<br> Make wealthy every word of him who praises you: accept with favour, both N&#257;satyas, this my laud.<br> 5 Ye made for Tugra's son amid the water-floods that animated ship with wings to fly withal,<br> Whereon with God-devoted mind ye brought him forth, and fled with easy flight from out the mighty surge.<br> 6 Four ships most welcome in the midst of ocean, urged by the A&#347;vins, save the son of Tugra,<br> Him who was cast down headlong in the waters, plunged in the thick inevitable darkness.<br> 7 What tree was that which stood fixed in surrounding sea to which the son of Tugra supplicating clung?<br> Like twigs, of which some winged creature may take hold, ye, A&#347;vins, bore him off safely to your renown.<br> 8 Welcome to you be this the hymn of praises uttered by M&#257;nas, O N&#257;satyas, Heroes,<br> From this our gathering where we offer Soma. May we find strengthening food in full abundance.</p>
