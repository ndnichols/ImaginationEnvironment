<p>1. AGNI, that valorous company adorned with ornaments of gold,<br> The people of the Maruts, I call down to-day even from the luminous realm of heaven.<br> 2 Even as thou thinkest in thy heart, thither my wishes also tend.<br> Those who have come most near to thine invoking calls, strengthen them fearful to behold.<br> 3 Earth, like a bounteous lady, liberal of her gifts, struck down and shaken, yet exultant, comes to us.<br> Impetuous as a bear, O Maruts, is youi rush terrible as a dreadful bull..<br> 4 They who with mighty strength o&#146;erthrow like oxen difficult to yoke,<br> Cause e&#146;en the heavenly stone to shake ' yea, shake the rocky mountain as they race along.<br> 5 Rise up! even now with lauds I call the very numerous company,<br> Unequalled, of these Maruts, like a herd of kine, grown up together in their strength.<br> 6 Bind to your car the bright red mares, yoke the red coursers to your car.<br> Bind to the pole, to draw, the fleet-foot tawny steeds, the best at drawing, to the pole.<br> 7 Yea, and this loudly-neighing bright red vigorous horse who hath been sutioned, fair to see,<br> Let him not cause delay, O Maruts,, in your course, urge ye him onward in your cars.<br> 8 The Maruts&#146; chariot, ever fain to gather glory, we invoke,<br> Which Rodas&#299; hath mounted, bringing pleasant gifts, with Maruts in her company.<br> 9 I call that brilliant band of yours, adorable, rapid on the car<br> Whereon the bounteous Dame, auspicious, nobly born, shows glorious with the Marut host.</p>
