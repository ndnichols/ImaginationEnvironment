<TD><P>And the word of YHVH came unto Jonah the second time, saying,</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Arise, go unto         
Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>So Jonah arose,   
and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of YHVH. Now Nineveh was an        
exceeding great city of three days' journey.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's    
journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be           
overthrown.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>So 
the people of Nineveh believed ELOHIYM, and proclaimed a fast, and put on       
sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>For word came unto the king 
of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and    
covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And he caused it to be proclaimed and          
published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let 
neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor  
drink water:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>  
But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto ELOHIYM: 
yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is   
in their hands.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Who can tell if ELOHIYM will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce  
anger, that we perish not?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>     
10</H4></TD><TD><P>And ELOHIYM saw their works, that they turned from their     
evil way; and ELOHIYM repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do   
unto them; and he did it not.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
