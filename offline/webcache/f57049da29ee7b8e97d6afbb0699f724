<p>1. I GRASP at you when power and strength begin to dawn: bedew ye, Indra and the Maruts, Heaven and Earth,<br> That Day and Night, in every hall of sacrifice, may wait on us and bless us when they first spring forth.<br> 2 Press the libation out, most excellent of all: the Pressing-stone is grasped like a hand-guided steed.<br> So let it win the valour that subdues the foe, and the fleet courser's might that speeds to ample wealth.<br> 3 Juice that this Stone pours out removes defect of ours, as in old time it brought prosperity to man.<br> At sacrifices they established holy rites on Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar's milk-blent juice bright with the hue of steeds.<br> 4 Drive ye the treacherous demons far away from us: keep Nirrti afar and banish Penury.<br> Pour riches forth for us with troops of hero sons, and bear ye up, O Stones, the song that visits Gods.<br> 5 To you who are more mighty than the heavens themselves, who, finishing your task with more than Vibhvan's speed,<br> More rapidly than V&#257;yu seize the Soma juice, better than Agni give us food, to you I sing.<br> 6 Stirred be the glorious Stones: let it press out the juice, the Stone with heavenly song that reaches up to heaven,<br> There where the men draw forth the meath for which they long, sending their voice around in rivalry of speed.<br> 7 The Stones press out the Soma, swift as car-borne men, and, eager for the spoil, drain forth the sap thereof<br> To fill the beaker, they exhaust the udder's store, as the men purify oblations with their lips.<br> 8 Ye, present men, have been most skilful in your work, even ye, O Stones who pressed Soma for Indra's drink.<br> May all ye have of fair go to the Heavenly Race, and all your treasure to the earthly worshipper.</p>
