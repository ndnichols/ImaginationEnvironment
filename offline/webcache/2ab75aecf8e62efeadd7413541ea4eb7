<p>1. HE who sate down as Hotar-priest, the &#7770;&#7779;i, our Father, offering up all things existing,&#151;<br> He, seeking through his wish a great possession, came among men on earth as archetypal.<br> 2 What was the place whereon he took his station? What was it that supported him? How was it?<br> Whence Visvakarman, seeing all, producing the earth, with mighty power disclosed the heavens.<br> 3 He who hath eyes on all sides round about him, a mouth on all sides, arms and feet on all sides,<br> He, the Sole God, producing earth and heaven, weldeth them, with his arms as wings, together.<br> 4 What was the tree, what wood in sooth produced it, from which they fashioned out the earth and heaven?<br> Ye thoughtful men inquire within your spirit whereon he stood when he established all things.<br> 5 Nine highest, lowest, sacrificial natures, and these thy mid-most here, O Visvakarman,<br> Teach thou thy friends at sacrifice, O Blessed, and come thyself, exalted, to our worship.<br> 6 Bring thou thyself, exalted with oblation, O Visvakarman, Earth and Heaven to worship.<br> Let other men around us live in folly here let us have a rich and liberal patron.<br> 7 Let us invoke to-day, to aid our labour, the Lord of Speech, the thought-swift Visvakarman.<br> May he hear kindly all our invocations who gives all bliss for aid, whose works are righteous.</p>
