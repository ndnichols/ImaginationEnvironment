<p>1. RICH in all blessings, A&#347;vins come ye hither: this place on earth is called your own possession,<br> Like a strong horse with a fair back it standeth, whereon, as in a lap, ye seat you firmly.<br> 2 This most delightful eulogy awaits you in the man's house drink-offering hath been heated,<br> Which bringeth you over the seas and rivers, yoking as&#146;twere two well-matched shining horses.<br> 3 Whatever dwellings ye possess, O A&#347;vins, in fields of men or in the streams of heaven,<br> Resting upon the summit of the mountain, or bringing food to him who gives oblation,<br> 4 Delight yourselves, ye Gods, in plants and waters when &#7770;&#7779;is give them and ye find they suit You.<br> Enriching us with treasures in abundance ye have looked back to former generations.<br> 5 A&#347;vins, though ye have heard them oft aforetime, regard the many prayers which &#7770;&#7779;is offer.<br> Come to the man even as his heart desireth: may we enjoy your most delightful favour.<br> 6 Come to the sacrifice offered you, N&#257;satyas, with men, oblations, and prayer duly uttered.<br> Come to Vasi&#7779;&#7789;ha as his heart desireth, for unto you these holy hymns are chanted.<br> 7 This is the thought, this is the song, O A&#347;vins: accept this hymn of ours, ye Steers, with favour.<br> May these our prayers addressed to you come nigh you. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
