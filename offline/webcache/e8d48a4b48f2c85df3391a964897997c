<TD><P>And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and YHVH had given  
him rest round about from all his enemies;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See   
now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of ELOHIYM dwelleth within       
curtains.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart; for YHVH is with    
thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And it   
came to pass that night, that the word of YHVH came unto Nathan, saying,</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Go and tell my    
servant David, Thus saith YHVH, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell    
in?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Whereas I  
have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of    
Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a       
tabernacle.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>In 
all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a  
word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people       
Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Now therefore so shalt thou say     
unto my servant David, Thus saith YHVH of hosts, I took thee from the           
sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over           
Israel:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And I  
was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies    
out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the    
great men that are in the earth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10>   
<H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel,    
and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no   
more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as        
beforetime,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel, and  
have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also YHVH telleth thee that he 
will make thee an house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy       
fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy      
bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>He shall build an house for my name, and I will 
stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>I will be his father, and he shall be my son.   
If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the     
stripes of the children of men:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>
15</H4></TD><TD><P>But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it    
from Saul, whom I put away before thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And thine house and thy kingdom shall be        
established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>According to    
all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto     
David.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Then  
went king David in, and sat before YHVH, and he said, Who am I, O ADONAY YHVH?  
and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And this was yet a small thing in 
thy sight, O ADONAY YHVH; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for  
a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, O ADONAY YHVH?</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And what can David   
say more unto thee? for thou, ADONAY YHVH, knowest thy servant.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>For thy word's sake, and  
according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make    
thy servant know them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>Wherefore thou art great, O YHVH ELOHIYM: for there is none like    
thee, neither is there any ELOHIYM beside thee, according to all that we have   
heard with our ears.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like      
Israel, whom ELOHIYM went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a  
name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy     
people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their    
gods?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>For    
thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for   
ever: and thou, YHVH, art become their ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And now, O YHVH ELOHIYM, the word that thou  
hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for  
ever, and do as thou hast said.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>
26</H4></TD><TD><P>And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, YHVH of      
hosts is the ELOHIYM over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be     
established before thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4>
</TD><TD><P>For thou, O YHVH of hosts, ELOHIYM of Israel, hast revealed to thy  
servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found   
in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And now, O ADONAY YHVH, thou art that ELOHIYM,  
and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy            
servant:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may 
continue for ever before thee: for thou, O ADONAY YHVH, hast spoken it: and     
with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.</P></TD>
