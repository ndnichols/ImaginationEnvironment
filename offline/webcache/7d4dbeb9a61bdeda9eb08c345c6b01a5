<p>1. WHAT friend of man, God-loving, hath delighted, yearning therefor, this day in Indra's friendship?<br> Who with enkindled flame and flowing Soma laudeth him for his great protecting favour?<br> 2 Who hath with prayer bowed to the Soma-lover? What pious man endues the beams of morning?<br> Who seeks bond, friendship, brotherhood with Indra? Who hath recourse unto the Sage for succour?<br> 3 Who claims to-day the Deities' protection, asks Aditi for light, or the &#256;dityas?<br> Of whose pressed stalk of Soma drink the A&#347;vins, Indra, and Agni, well-inclined in spirit?<br> 4 To him shall Agni Bh&#257;rata give shelter: long shall he look upon the Sun up-rising,<br> Who sayeth, Let us press the juice for Indra, man's Friend, the Hero manliest of heroes.<br> 5 Him neither few men overcome, nor many to him shall Aditi give spacious shelter.<br> Dear is the pious, the devout, to Indra dear is the zealous, dear the Soma-bringer.<br> 6 This Hero curbs the mighty for the zealous: the presser's brew Indra possesses solely:<br> No brother, kin, or friend to him who pours not, destroyer of the dumb who would resist him.<br> 7 Not with the wealthy churl who pours no Soma doth Indra, Soma-drinker, bind alliance.<br> He draws away his wealth and slays him naked, own Friend to him who offers, for oblation.<br> 8 Highest and lowest, men who stand between diem, going, returning, dwelling in contentment,<br> Those who show forth their strength when urged to battle-these are the men who call for aid on Indra.</p>
