<p>1. AGNI I hold as herald, the munificent, the gracious, Son of Strength, who knoweth all that live, as holy Singer, knowing all,<br> Lord of fair rites, a God with form erected turning to the Gods,<br> He, when the flame hath sprung forth from the holy oil, the offered fatness, longeth for it with his glow.<br> 2 We, sacrificing, call on thee best worshipper, the eldest of A&#7749;girases, Singer, with hymns, thee, brilliant One! with singers&#146; hymns;<br> Thee, wandering round as &#146;t were the sky, who art the invoking Priest of men,<br> Whom, Bull with hair of flame the people must observe, the people that he speed them on.<br> 3 He with his shining glory blazing far and wide, he verily it is who slayeth demon foes, slayeth the demons like an axe:<br> At whose close touch things solid shake, and what is stable yields like trees.<br> Subduing all, he keeps his ground and flinches not, from the skilled archer flinches not.<br> 4 To him, as one who knows, even things solid yield: unrough fire-sticks heated hot he gives his gifts to aid. Men offer Agni gifts for aid.<br> He deeply piercing many a thing hews it like wood with fervent glow.<br> Even hard and solid food he crunches with his might, yea, hard and solid food with might.<br> 5 Here near we place the sacrificial food for him who shines forth fairer in the night than in the day, with life then stronger than by day.<br> His life gives sure and firm defence as that one giveth to a son.<br> The during fires enjoy things given and things not given, the during fires enjoy as food.<br> 6 He, roaring very loudly like the Maruts&#146; host, in fertile cultivated fields adorable, in desert spots adorable,<br> Accepts and eats our offered gifts, ensign of sacrifice by desert;<br> So let all, joying, love his path when he is glad, as men pursue a path for bliss.<br> 7 Even as they who sang forth hymns, addressed to heaven, the Bh&#7771;gus with their prayer and praise invited him, the Bh&#7771;gus rubbing, offering gifts.<br> For radiant Agni, Lord of all these treasures, is exceeding strong.<br> May he, the wise, accept the grateful coverings, the wise accept the coverings.<br> 8 Thee we invoke, the Lord of all our settled homes, common to all, the household's guardian, to enjoy, bearer of true hymns, to enjoy.<br> Thee we invoke, the guest of men, by whose mouth, even as a sire's,<br> All these Immortals come to gain their food of life, oblations come to Gods as food.<br> 9 Thou, Agni, most victorious with thy conquering strength, most Mighty One, art born for service of the Gods, like wealth for service of the Gods.<br> Most mighty is thine ecstasy, most splendid is thy mental power.<br> Therefore men wait upon thee, undecaying One, like vassals, undecaying One.<br> 10 To him the mighty, conquering with victorious strength, to Agni walking with the dawn, who sendeth kine, be sung your laud, to Agni sung;<br> As he who with oblation comes calls him aloud in every place.<br> Before the brands of fire he shouteth singerlike, the herald, kindler of the brands.<br> 11 Agni, beheld by us in nearest neighbourhood, accordant with the Gods, bring us, with gracious love, great riches with thy gracious love.<br> Give us O Mightiest, what is great, to see and to enjoy the earth.<br> As one of awful power, stir up heroic might for those who praise thee, Bounteous Lord!</p>
