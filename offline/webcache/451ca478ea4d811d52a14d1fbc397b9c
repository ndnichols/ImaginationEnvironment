<p>1. As, like the Morning, thou hast filled, O Indra, both the earth and heaven.<br> So as the Mighty One, great King of all the mighty world of men, the Goddess Mother brought thee forth, the Blessed Mother gave thee life.<br> 2 Relax that mortal's stubborn strength whose heart is bent on wickedness.<br> Trample him down beneath thy feet who watches for and aims at us. The Goddess Mother brought thee forth, the Blessed Mother gave thee life.<br> 3 Shake down, O Slayer of the foe, those great all splendid enemies.<br> With all thy powers, O &#346;akra, all thine helps, O Indra, shake them down:<br> 4 As thou, O &#346;atakratu, thou, O Indrv, shakest all things down<br> As wealth for him who sheds the juice, with thine assistance thousandfold.<br> 5 Around, on every side like drops of sweat let lightning-flashes fall.<br> Let all malevolence pass away from us like threads of Darva grass.<br> 6 Thou bearest in thine hand a lance like a long hook, great Counsellor!<br> As with his foremost foot a goat, draw down the branch, O Maghavan.<br> 7 Never, O Gods, do we offend, nor are we ever obstinate: we walk as holy texts command.<br> Closely we clasp and cling to you, cling to your sides, beneath your arms.</p>
