1</H4></TD><TD><P>In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the         
wilderness of Judaea,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>For this is he that    
was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the     
wilderness, Prepare ye the way of YHVH, make his paths straight.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And the same John had his   
raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat    
was locusts and wild honey.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>     
5</H4></TD><TD><P>Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the   
region round about Jordan,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>But when he saw many   
of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O        
generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Bring forth       
therefore fruits meet for repentance:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And think not to say within yourselves, We have   
Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that ELOHIYM is able of these stones 
to raise up children unto Abraham.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10> 
<H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: 
therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast 
into the fire.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me 
is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you   
with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12>
<H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge    
his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff  
with unquenchable fire.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>Then cometh YAHSHUA from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be         
baptized of him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and     
comest thou to me?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And YAHSHUA answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it 
becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA, when he was      
baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were       
opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of ELOHIYM descending like a dove, and   
lighting upon him:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am 
well pleased.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John
