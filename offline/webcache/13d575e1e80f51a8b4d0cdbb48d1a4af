<p>1. FROM near or far away may mighty Indra giver of succour, come for our protection<br> Lord of men, armed with thunder, with the Strongest, slaying his foes in conflict, in the battles.<br> 2 May Indra come to us with Tawny Coursers, inclined to us, to favour and enrich us.<br> May Maghavan, loud-voiced and wielding thunder, stand by us at this sacrifice, in combat.<br> 3 Thou, honouring this our sacrifice, O Indra, shalt give us strength and fill us full of courage.<br> To win the booty, Thunder-armed! like hunters may we with thee subdue in fight our foemen.<br> 4 Loving us well, benevolent, close beside us, drink, Godlike Indra, of the well-pressed Soma.<br> Drink of the meath we offer, and delight thee with food that cometh from the mountain ridges.<br> 5 Him who is sung aloud by recent sages, like a ripe-fruited tree, a scythe-armed victor,&#151;<br> I, like a bridegroom thinking of his consort, call hither Indra, him invoked of many;<br> 6 Him who in native strength is like a mountain, the lofty Indra born or old for conquest,<br> Terrific wielder of the ancient thunder. filled full with splendour as a jar with water.<br> 7 Whom from of old there is not one to hinder, none to curtail the riches of his bounty.<br> Pouring forth freely, O thou Strong and Mighty, vouchsafe us riches, God invoked of many!<br> 8 Of wealth and homes of men thou art the ruler, and opener of the stable of the cattle.<br> Helper of men, winner of spoil in combats, thou leadest to an ample heap of riches.<br> 9 By what great might is he renowned as strongest, wherewith the Lofty One stirs up wild battles?<br> Best soother of the worshipper's great sorrow, he gives possessions to the man who lauds him.<br> 10 Slay us not; bring, bestow onus the ample gift which thou hast to give to him who offers.<br> At this new gift, with this laud sung before thee, extolling thee, we, Indra, will declare it.<br> 11 Now, Indra! lauded, glorified with praises, let power swell high, like rivers, for the singer.<br> A new hymn, Lord of Bays! for thee is fashioned. May we, car-born, through song be victors ever.</p>
