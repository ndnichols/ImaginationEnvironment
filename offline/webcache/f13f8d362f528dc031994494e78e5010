<p>1. HE with the long loose locks supports Agni, and moisture, heaven, and earth:<br> He is all sky to look upon: he with long hair is called this light.<br> 2 The Munis, girdled with the wind, wear garments soiled of yellow hue.<br> They, following the wind's swift course go where the Gods have gone before.<br> 3 Transported with our Munihood we have pressed on into the winds:<br> You therefore, mortal men. behold our natural bodies and no more.<br> 4 The Muni, made associate in the holy work of every God,<br> Looking upon all varied forms flies through the region of the air.<br> 5 The Steed of V&#257;ta, V&#257;yu's friend, the Muni, by the Gods impelled,<br> In both the oceans hath his home, in eastern and in western sea.<br> 6 Treading the path of sylvan beasts, Gandharvas, and Apsarases,<br> He with long locks, who knows the wish, is a sweet most delightful friend<br> 7 V&#257;yu hath churned for him: for him he poundeth things most hard to bend,<br> When he with long loose locks hath drunk, with Rudra, water from the cup.</p>
