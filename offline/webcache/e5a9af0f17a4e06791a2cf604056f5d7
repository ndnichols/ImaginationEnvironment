<p>1. SHEDDING her light on human habitations this Child of Heaven hath called us from our slumber;<br> She who at night-time with her argent lustre hath shown herself e&#146;en through the shades of darkness.<br> 2 All this with red-rayed steeds have they divided: the Dawns on bright cars shine in wondrous fashion.<br> They, bringing near the stately rite's commencement, drive far away the night's surrounding shadows.<br> 3 Dawns, bringing hither, to the man who worships, glory and power and might and food and vigour,<br> Opulent, with imperial sway like heroes, favour your servant and this day enrich him.<br> 4 Now is there treasure for the man who serves you, now for the hero, Dawns! who brings oblation;<br> Now for the singer when he sings the praise-song. Even to one like me ye brought aforetime.<br> 5 O Dawn who standest on the mountain ridges, A&#7749;girases now praise thy stalls of cattle.<br> With prayer and holy hymn they burst them open: the heroes' calling on the Gods was fruitful.<br> 6 Shine on us as of old, thou Child of Heaven,on him, rich Maid! who serves like Bharadv&#257;ja.<br> Give to the singer wealth with noble heroes, and upon us bestow wide-spreading glory.</p>
