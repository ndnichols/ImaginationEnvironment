<p>1. I PRAISE the God of wondrous might like Indra, the lovely pleasant Guest whom all must welcome.<br> May Agni, Priest and Master of the household, give hero strength and all-sustaining riches.<br> 2 O Agni, graciously accept this song of mine, thou passing-wise who knowest every ordinance.<br> Enwrapped in holy oil further the course of prayer: the Gods bestow according to thy holy law.<br> 3 Immortal, wandering round the seven stations, give, a liberal Giver, to the pious worshipper,<br> Wealth, Agni, with brave sons and ready for his use: welcome the man who comes with fuel unto thee.<br> 4 The seven who bring oblations worship thee, the Strong, the first, the Great Chief Priest, Ensign of sacrifice,<br> The oil-anointed Bull, Agni who hears, who sends as God full hero strength to him who freely gives.<br> 5 First messenger art thou, meet for election: drink thou thy fill invited to the Anirta,<br> The Maruts in the votary's house adorned thee; with lauds the Bh&#7771;gus gave thee light and glory.<br> 6 Milking the teeming Cow for all-sustaining food. O Wise One, for the worship-loving worshipper,<br> Thou, Agni, dropping oil, thrice lighting works of Law, showest thy wisdom circling home and sacrifice.<br> 7 They who at flushing of this dawn appointed thee their messenger, these men have paid thee reverence.<br> Gods strengthened thee for work that must be glorified, Agni, while they made butter pure for sacrifice.<br> 8 Arrangers in our synods, Agni, while they sang Vasisistha s sons have called thee down, the Potent One.<br> Maintain the growth of wealth with men who sacrifice. Ye Gods, preserve us with your blessings evermore.</p>
