1</H4></TD><TD><P>The word of YHVH came unto me again, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>What mean ye, that ye use this  
proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour      
grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>As I live, saith the ADONAY YHVH,   
ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Behold, all souls are mine; 
as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that   
sinneth, it shall die.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And hath not      
eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the   
house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbour's wife, neither hath come   
near to a menstruous woman,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>     
7</H4></TD><TD><P>And hath not oppressed any, but hath restored to the debtor   
his pledge, hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his bread to the hungry,  
and hath covered the naked with a garment;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>He that hath not given forth upon usury, neither  
hath taken any increase, that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath       
executed true judgment between man and man,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my      
judgments, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the ADONAY    
YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>If he  
beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that doeth the like to    
any one of these things,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And that doeth not any of those duties, but even hath eaten upon    
the mountains, and defiled his neighbour's wife,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Hath oppressed the poor and       
needy, hath spoiled by violence, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted  
up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Hath given forth upon usury, and  
hath taken increase: shall he then live? he shall not live: he hath done all    
these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Now, lo, if he beget 
a son, that seeth all his father's sins which he hath done, and considereth,    
and doeth not such like,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4>
</TD><TD><P>That hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his  
eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his neighbour's      
wife,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>       
Neither hath oppressed any, hath not withholden the pledge, neither hath        
spoiled by violence, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered   
the naked with a garment,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>      
17</H4></TD><TD><P>That hath taken off his hand from the poor, that hath not    
received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath walked in my      
statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely      
live.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>As for 
his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his brother by violence, and  
did that which is not good among his people, lo, even he shall die in his       
iniquity.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son 
hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath kept all my statutes, and    
hath done them, he shall surely live.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son    
shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the    
iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and  
the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>But if the wicked will turn from all his     
sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is     
lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>All his transgressions that he    
hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that 
he hath done he shall live.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>    
23</H4></TD><TD><P>Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith 
the ADONAY YHVH: and not that he should return from his ways, and live?</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>But when the         
righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and     
doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he     
live? All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his    
trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them   
shall he die.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Yet ye say, The way of the ADONAY is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel; 
Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>When a righteous man turneth away from his   
righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity     
that he hath done shall he die.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>
27</H4></TD><TD><P>Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness  
that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save 
his soul alive.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD>
<P>Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he 
hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Yet saith the house of Israel,    
The way of the ADONAY is not equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal?   
are not your ways unequal?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>     
30</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one     
according to his ways, saith the ADONAY YHVH. Repent, and turn yourselves from  
all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>Cast away from you all your   
transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a    
new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>For I have no pleasure in the     
death of him that dieth, saith the ADONAY YHVH: wherefore turn yourselves, and  
live ye.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M.
