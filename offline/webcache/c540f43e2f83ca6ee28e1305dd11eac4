1</H4></TD><TD><P>Then came to YAHSHUA scribes and Pharisees, which were of     
Jerusalem, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they    
wash not their hands when they eat bread.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye     
also transgress the commandment of ELOHIYM by your tradition?</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>For ELOHIYM commanded, saying,  
Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him    
die the death.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>
But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by   
whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And honour not his father or his mother, he shall 
be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of ELOHIYM of none effect by your    
tradition.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye  
hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>This people draweth nigh unto me    
with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from 
me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>But in     
vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And he called   
the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Not that which goeth into the     
mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a   
man.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Then    
came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were     
offended, after they heard this saying?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>But he answered and said, Every plant, which my 
heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Let them alone: they be blind     
leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the 
ditch.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Then  
answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA said, Are ye  
also yet without understanding?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>
17</H4></TD><TD><P>Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the 
mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>But those things which        
proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>For out of the  
heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false   
witness, blasphemies:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen   
hands defileth not a man.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>      
21</H4></TD><TD><P>Then YAHSHUA went thence, and departed into the coasts of    
Tyre and Sidon.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD>
<P>And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto   
him, saying, Have mercy on me, O ADONAY, thou son of David; my daughter is      
grievously vexed with a devil.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4> 
23</H4></TD><TD><P>But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and   
besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>But he answered and said, I   
am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Then came she and worshipped  
him, saying, ADONAY, help me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>  
26</H4></TD><TD><P>But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the         
children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And she said, Truth, ADONAY: yet the dogs eat   
of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Then YAHSHUA answered and said    
unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And   
her daughter was made whole from that very hour.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA departed from thence, 
and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat     
down there.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame,      
blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at YAHSHUA' feet; and  
he healed them:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD>
<P>Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the   
maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified  
the ELOHIYM of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>Then YAHSHUA called his disciples unto him, and said, I have        
compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and  
have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in  
the way.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the          
wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA saith unto them, How many loaves    
have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And he commanded the multitude to 
sit down on the ground.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and   
brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And they did    
all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left     
seven baskets full.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and           
children.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of      
Magdala.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M.
