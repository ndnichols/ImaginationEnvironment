VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>O foolish Galatians, who hath       
bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes YAHSHUA     
MASHIYACH hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>This only would I learn of you, 
Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Are ye so         
foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Have ye suffered  
so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>He therefore that ministereth to you the       
Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or 
by the hearing of faith?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>Even as Abraham believed YHVH, and it was accounted to him for      
righteousness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>
Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of    
Abraham.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
the scripture, foreseeing that YHVH would justify the heathen through faith,    
preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be   
blessed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>So    
then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>For as many as are of the     
works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one    
that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to   
do them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>But 
that no man is justified by the law in the sight of ELOHIYM, it is evident:     
for, The just shall live by faith.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12> 
<H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth     
them shall live in them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4>
</TD><TD><P>MASHIYACH hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a  
curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>That the        
blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through YAHSHUA MASHIYACH; that  
we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Brethren, I speak after the       
manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no    
man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises   
made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed,   
which is MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of ELOHIYM  
in MASHIYACH, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot    
disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>For if the inheritance be of the  
law, it is no more of promise: but ELOHIYM gave it to Abraham by promise.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore then  
serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should   
come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of 
a mediator.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but ELOHIYM is one.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Is the law then against the   
promises of ELOHIYM? Forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have 
given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>But the scripture hath        
concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of YAHSHUA MASHIYACH might   
be given to them that believe.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4> 
23</H4></TD><TD><P>But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up   
unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore the law was our         
schoolmaster to bring us unto MASHIYACH, that we might be justified by          
faith.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>But   
after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>For ye are all the        
children of ELOHIYM by faith in MASHIYACH YAHSHUA.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>For as many of you as have been   
baptized into MASHIYACH have put on MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is     
neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in  
MASHIYACH YAHSHUA.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And if ye be MASHIYACH's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs          
according to the promise.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright
