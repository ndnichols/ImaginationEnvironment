NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>And the children of Israel set forward, and       
pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And Balak the son of Zippor saw 
all that Israel had done to the Amorites.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because   
they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moab said     
unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all that are round    
about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of     
Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the   
son of Beor to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his 
people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt:     
behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Come now          
therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me:   
peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them 
out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom   
thou cursest is cursed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the   
rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto  
him the words of Balak.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you  
word again, as YHVH shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with     
Balaam.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
ELOHIYM came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And Balaam said unto      
ELOHIYM, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, saying,</P>

out.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And     
ELOHIYM said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the 
people: for they are blessed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>  
13</H4></TD><TD><P>And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes 
of Balak, Get you into your land: for YHVH refuseth to give me leave to go with 
you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And the 
princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to 
come with us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And they came   
to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I  
pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>For I will promote thee unto very great honor,  
and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee,      
curse me this people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak   
would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of 
YHVH my ELOHIYM, to do less or more.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

this night, that I may know what YHVH will say unto me more.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And ELOHIYM came unto Balaam  
at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, and go with 
them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And Balaam rose up   
in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And ELOHIYM's anger  
was kindled because he went: and the angel of YHVH stood in the way for an      
adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants     
were with him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And the ass saw the angel of YHVH standing in the way, and his sword drawn   
in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field:  
and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>But the angel of YHVH stood in a  
path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the    
ass saw the angel of YHVH, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed        
Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And the angel of YHVH went        
further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the    
right hand or to the left.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>     
27</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the ass saw the angel of YHVH, she fell down under  
Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH opened 
the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee,     
that thou hast smitten me these three times?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast 
mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill        
thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever  
since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he     
said, Nay.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Then YHVH opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of YHVH standing in   
the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell  
flat on his face.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And the angel of YHVH said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine   
ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because thy way is 
perverse before me:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had 
turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>And Balaam said unto 
the angel of YHVH, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way  
against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And the angel   
of YHVH said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak 
unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>And when Balak  
heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which  
is in the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost coast.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I 
not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me?   
am I not able indeed to promote thee to honor?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come    
unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that ELOHIYM  
putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto  
Kirjathhuzoth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes     
that were with him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought   
him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost part   
of the people.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John
