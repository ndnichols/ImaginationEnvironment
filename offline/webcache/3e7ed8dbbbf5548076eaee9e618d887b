thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he be of the children of    
Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth any of his seed 
unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall      
stone him with stones.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4>

their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him   
not:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Then I    
will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him

among their people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD>
