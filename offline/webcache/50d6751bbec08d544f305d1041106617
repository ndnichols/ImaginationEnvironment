<p>1. As, Indra, from great treason thou protectest, yea, from great treachery these who approach us,<br> So, marking well, Controller of the Maruts grant us their blessings, for they are thy dearest.<br> 2 The various doings of all mortal people by thee are ordered, in thy wisdom, Indra.<br> The host of Maruts goeth forth exulting to win the light-bestowing spoil of battle.<br> 3 That spear of thine sat firm for us, O Indra: the Maruts set their whole dread power in motion.<br> E&#146;en Agni shines resplendent in the brush-wood: the viands hold him as floods hold an island.<br> 4 Vouchsafe us now that opulence, O Indra, as guerdon won by mightiest donation.<br> May hymns that please thee cause the breast of V&#257;yu to swell as with the mead's refreshing sweetness.<br> 5 With thee, O Indra, are most bounteous riches that further every one who lives uprightly.<br> Now may these Maruts show us loving-kindness, Gods who of old were ever prompt to help us.<br> 6 Bring forth the Men who rain down boons, O Indra: exert thee in the great terrestrial region;<br> For their broad-chested speckled deer are standing like a King's armies on the field of battle.<br> 7 Heard is the roar of the advancing Maruts, terrific, glittering, and swiftly moving,<br> Who with their rush o&#146;erthrow as &#146;twere a sinner the mortal who would fight with those who love him<br> 8 Give to the M&#257;nas, Indra with Maruts, gifts universal, gifts of cattle foremost.<br> Thou, God, art praised with Gods who must be lauded. May we find strengthening food in full abundance.</p>
