<p>1. THEY who are glancing forth, like women, on their way, doers of mighty deeds, swift racers, Rudra's Sons,<br> The Maruts have made heaven and earth increase and grow: in sacrifices they delight, the strong and wild.<br> 2 Grown to their perfect strength greatness have they attained; the Rudras have established their abode in heaven.<br> Singing their song of praise and generating might, they have put glory on, the Sons whom P&#7771;&#347;ni bare.<br> 3 When, Children of the Cow, they shine in bright attire, and on their fair limbs lay their golden ornaments,<br> They drive away each adversary from their path, and, following their traces, fatness floweth down,<br> 4 When, mighty Warriors, ye who glitter with your spears, o&#146;erthrowing with your strength e&#146;en what is ne&#146;er o&#146;erthrown,<br> When, O ye Maruts, ye the host that send the rain, had harnessed to your cars the thought-fleet spotted deer.<br> 5 When ye have harnessed to your cars the spotted deer, urging the thunderbolt, O Maruts, to the fray,<br> Forth rush the torrents of the dark red stormy cloud, and moisten, like a skin, the earth with water-floods.<br> 6 Let your swift-gliding coursers bear you hitherward with their fleet pinions. Come ye forward with your arms.<br> Sit on the grass; a wide seat hath been made for you: delight yourselves, O Maruts, in the pleasant food.<br> 7 Strong in their native strength to greatness have they grown, stepped to the firmament and made their dwelling wide.<br> When Vi&#7779;&#7751;u saved the Soma bringing wild delight, the Maruts sate like birds on their dear holy grass.<br> 8 In sooth like heroes fain for fight they rush about, like combatants fame-seeking have they striven in war.<br> Before the Maruts every creature is afraid: the men are like to Kings, terrible to behold.<br> 9 When Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar deft of hand had turned the thunderbolt, golden, with thousand edges, fashioned more skilfully,<br> Indra received it to perform heroic deeds. V&#7771;tra he slew, and forced the flood of water forth.<br> 10 They with their vigorous strength pushed the well up on high, and clove the cloud in twain though it was passing strong.<br> The Maruts, bounteous Givers, sending forth their voice, in the wild joy of Soma wrought their glorious deeds.<br> 11 They drave the cloud transverse directed hitherward, and poured the fountain forth for thirsting Gotama.<br> Shining with varied light they come to him with help: they with their might fulfilled the longing of the sage.<br> 12 The shelters which ye have for him who lauds you, bestow them threefold on the man who offers.<br> Extend the same boons unto us, ye Maruts. Give us, O Heroes, wealth with noble offspring.</p>
