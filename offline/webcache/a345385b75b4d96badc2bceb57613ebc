<p>1. OFFER ye up as praise to him that wherein Indra takes delight.<br> The Soma-bringers magnify Indra's great energy with hymns. Good are the gifts that Indra gives.<br> 2 Sole among chiefs, companionless, impetuous, and peerless, he<br> Hath waxen great o&#146;er many folk, yea., over all things born, in might.<br> 3 Lord of swift bounty, he will win e&#146;en with a steed of worthless sort.<br> This, Indra, must be told of thee who wilt perform heroic deeds.<br> 4 Come to us hither: let us pay devotions that enhance thy might,<br> For which, Most Potent! thou wouldst fain bless the man here who strives for fame.<br> 5 For thou, O Indra, makest yet more bold the spirit of the bold<br> Who with strong Soma serveth thee, still ready with his reverent prayers.<br> 6 Worthy of song, he looketh down as a man looketh into wells.<br> Pleased with the Soma-bringer's skill he maketh him his mate and friend.<br> 7 In strength and wisdom all the Gods, Indra, have yielded unto thee.<br> Be thou the Guard of all, O thou whom many praise.<br> 8 Praised, Indra, is this might of thine, best for the service of the Gods,<br> That thou with power dost slay V&#7771;tra, O Lord of Strength.<br> 9 He makes the races of mankind like synods of the Beauteous One.<br> Indra knows this his manifest deed, and is renowned.<br> 10 Thy might, O Indra, at its birth, thee also, and thy mental power,<br> In thy care, Maghavan rich in kine! they have increased exceedingly.<br> 11 O V&#7771;tra-slayer, thou and I will both combine for winning spoil.<br> Even malignity will consent, O Bolt-armed Hero, unto us.<br> 12 Let us extol this Indra as truthful and never as untrue.<br> Dire is his death who pours no gifts great light hath he who offers them. Good are the gifts that Indra gives.</p>
