<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>Then all Israel gathered        
themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy        
flesh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And     
moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou wast he that leddest out   
and broughtest in Israel: and YHVH thy ELOHIYM said unto thee, Thou shalt feed  
my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore came all the      
elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in  
Hebron before YHVH; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the  
word of YHVH by Samuel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where   
the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And the inhabitants of Jebus said   
to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of     
Zion, which is the city of David.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6>   
<H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first     
shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was   
chief.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And     
David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And he built the city  
round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the     
city.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>So David 
waxed greater and greater: for YHVH of hosts was with him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>These also are the chief of the   
mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, 
and with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of YHVH concerning 
Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
this is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite,  
the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain   
by him at one time.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of   
the three mighties.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD>
<TD><P>He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered  
together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people 
fled from before the Philistines.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14>  
<H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and 
delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and YHVH saved them by a great          
deliverance.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>
Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave  
of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of           
Rephaim.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
David was then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison was then at           
Bethlehem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the 
well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And the three brake through the host of the     
Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, 
and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but      
poured it out to YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And said, My ELOHIYM forbid it me, that I should do this thing:     
shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for 
with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink  
it. These things did these three mightiest.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief   
of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them, and 
had a name among the three.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>    
21</H4></TD><TD><P>Of the three, he was more honorable than the two; for he was 
their captain: howbeit he attained not to the first three.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the  
son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike   
men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And he slew an       
Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand  
was a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and     
plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own         
spear.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>These 
things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three        
mighties.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Behold, he was honorable among the thirty, but attained not to the first three: 
and David set him over his guard.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26>
