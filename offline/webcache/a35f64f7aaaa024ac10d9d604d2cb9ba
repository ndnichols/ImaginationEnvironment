<p>1. WHOSO enkindles thee, with lifted ladle, and thrice this day offers thee food, O Agni,<br> May he excel, triumphant through thy splendours, wise through thy mental power, O J&#257;tavedas.<br> 2 Whoso with toil and trouble brings thee fuel, serving the majesty of mighty Agni,<br> He, kindling thee at evening and at morning, prospers, and comes to wealth, and slays his foemen.<br> 3 Agni is Master of sublime dominion, Agni is Lord of strength and lofty riches.<br> Straightway the self-reliant God, Most Youthful, gives treasures to the mortal who adores him.<br> 4 Most Youthful God, whatever sin, through folly, we here, as human beings, have committed,<br> In sight of Aditi make thou us sinless remit, entirely, Agni, our offences.<br> 5 Even in the presence of great sin, O Agni, free us from prison of the Gods or mortals.<br> Never may we who are thy friends be injured: grant health and strength unto our seed and offspring.<br> 6 Even as ye here, Gods Excellent and Holy, have loosed the cow that by the foot was tethered,<br> So also set us free from this affliction long let our life, O Agni, be extended.</p>
