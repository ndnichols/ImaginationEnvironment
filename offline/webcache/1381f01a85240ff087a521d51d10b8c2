<p>1. THESE Dawns have raised their banner; in the eastern half of the mid-air they spread abroad their shining light.<br> Like heroes who prepare their weapons for the war, onward they come bright red in hue, the Mother Cows.<br> 2 Readily have the purple beams of light shot up; the Red Cows have they harnessed, easy to be yoked.<br> The Dawns have brought distinct perception as before: red-hued, they have attained their fulgent brilliancy.<br> 3 They sing their song like women active in their tasks, along their common path hither from far away,<br> Bringing refreshment to the liberal devotee, yea, all things to the worshipper who pours the juice.<br> 4 She, like a dancer, puts her broidered garments on: as a cow yields her udder so she bares her breast.<br> Creating light for all the world of life, the Dawn hath laid the darkness open as the cows their stall.<br> 5 We have beheld the brightness of her shining; it spreads and drives away the darksome monster.<br> Like tints that deck the Post at sacrifices, Heaven's Daughter hath attained her wondrous splendour.<br> 6 We have o&#146;erpast the limit of this darkness; Dawn breaking forth again brings clear perception.<br> She like a flatterer smiles in light for glory, and fair of face hath wakened to rejoice us.<br> 7 The Gotamas have praised Heaven's radiant Daughter, the leader of the charm of pleasant voices.<br> Dawn, thou conferrest on us strength with offspring and men, conspicuous with kine and horses.<br> 8 O thou who shinest forth in wondrous glory, urged onward by thy strength, auspicious Lady,<br> Dawn, may I gain that wealth, renowned and ample, in brave sons, troops of slaves, far-famed for horses.<br> 9 Bending her looks on all the world, the Goddess shines, widely spreading with her bright eye westward.<br> Waking to motion every living creature, she understands the voice of each adorer.<br> 10 Ancient of days, again&nbsp;again born newly, decking her beauty with the self-same raiment.<br> The Goddess wastes away the life of mortals, like a skilled hunter cutting birds in pieces.<br> 11 She hath appeared discovering heaven's borders: to the far distance she drives off her Sister.<br> Diminishing the days of human creatures, the Lady shines with all her lover's splendour.<br> 12 The bright, the blessed One shines forth extending her rays like kine, as a flood rolls his waters.<br> Never transgressing the divine commandments, she is beheld visible with the sunbeams.<br> 13 O Dawn enriched with ample wealth, bestow on us the wondrous gift<br> Wherewith we may support children and children's sons.<br> 14 Thou radiant mover of sweet sounds, with wealth of horses and of kine<br> Shine thou on us this day, O Dawn auspiciously.<br> 15 O Dawn enriched with holy rites, yoke to thy car thy purple steeds,<br> And then bring thou unto us all felicities.<br> 16 O A&#347;vins wonderful in act, do ye unanimous direct<br> Your chariot to our home wealthy in kine and gold.<br> 17 Ye who brought down the hymn from heaven, a light that giveth light to man,<br> Do ye, O A&#347;vins, bring strength hither unto us.<br> 18 Hither may they who wake at dawn bring, to drink Soma both the Gods<br> Health-givers Wonder-Workers, borne on paths of gold.</p>
