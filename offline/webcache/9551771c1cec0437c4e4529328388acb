1</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, that when YAHSHUA had finished these     
sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond    
Jordan;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>The Pharisees also came unto him,   
tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife  
for every cause?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made     
them at the beginning made them male and female,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And said, For this cause shall a    
man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall 
be one flesh?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore ELOHIYM hath    
joined together, let not man put asunder.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to  
give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>He saith unto them, Moses because   
of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from    
the beginning it was not so.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>    
9</H4></TD><TD><P>And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except 
it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso  
marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>His disciples say unto him, If    
the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>But he said unto them,    
All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>For there are some        
eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some        
eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made  
themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive 
it, let him receive it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should    
put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>But YAHSHUA said, Suffer  
little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the       
kingdom of heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And, behold, one came and said    
unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal      
life?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And he 
said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is,   
ELOHIYM: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>He saith unto him, Which? 
YAHSHUA said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou     
shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Honour thy father and thy mother: 
and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>The young man saith unto him, All these      
things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA said unto him, If thou    
wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou     
shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>But when the young man heard that 
saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said YAHSHUA unto his    
disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the   
kingdom of heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye 
of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of EL.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>When his disciples heard  
it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>But YAHSHUA beheld them,  
and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with ELOHIYM all things    
are possible.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and     
followed thee; what shall we have therefore?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA said unto them, Verily I say unto   
you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man    
shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones,    
judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for 
my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting     
life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>But    
many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.</P></TD></TR>
