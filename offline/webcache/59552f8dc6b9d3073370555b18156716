<p>1. WITH sacrifice exalt Agni who knows all life; worship him with oblation and the song of praise,<br> Well kindled, nobly fed; heaven's Lord, Celestial Priest, who labours at the pole where deeds of might are done.<br> 2 At night and morning, Agni, have they called to thee, like milch-kine in their stalls lowing to meet their young.<br> As messenger of heaven thou lightest all night long the families of men. Thou Lord of precious boons.<br> 3 Him have the Gods established at the region's base, doer of wondrous deeds, Herald of heaven and earth;<br> Like a most famous car, Agni the purely bright, like Mitra to be glorified among the folk.<br> 4 Him have they set in his own dwelling, in the vault, like the Moon waxing, fulgent, in the realm of air.<br> Bird of the firmament, observant with his eyes, guard of the place as &#146;twere, looking to Gods and men.<br> 5 May he as Priest encompass all the sacrifice. men throng to him with offerings and with hymns of praise.<br> Raging with jaws of gold among the growing plants, like heaven with all the stars, he quickens earth and sky.<br> 6 Such as thou art, brilliantly kindled for our weal, a liberal giver, send us riches in thy shine,<br> For our advantage, Agni, God, bring Heaven and Earth hither that they may taste oblation brought by man.<br> 7 Agni, give us great wealth, give riches thousandfold. unclose to us, like doors, strength that shall bring renown.<br> Make Heaven and Earth propitious through the power of prayer, and like the sky's bright sheen let mornings beam on us.<br> 8 Enkindled night by night at every morning's dawn, may he shine forth with red flame like the realm of light,&#151;<br> Agni adored in beauteous rites with lauds of men, fair guest of living man and King of all our folk.<br> 9 Song chanted by us men, O Agni, Ancient One, has swelled unto the deathless Gods in lofty heaven&#151;<br> A milch-cow yielding to the singer in the rites wealth manifold, in hundreds, even as he wills.<br> 10 Agni, may we show forth our valour with the steed or with the power of prayer beyond all other men;<br> And over the Five Races let our glory shine high like the realm of light and unsurpassable.<br> 11 Such, Conqueror! be to us, be worthy of our praise, thou for whom princes nobly born exert themselves;<br> Whose sacrifice the strong seek, Agni, when it shines for never-failing offspring in thine own abode.<br> 12 Knower of all that lives, O Agni may we both, singers of praise and chiefs, be in thy keeping still.<br> Help us to wealth exceeding good and glorious, abundant, rich in children and their progeny.<br> 13 The princely worshippers who send to those who sing thy praise, O Agni, guerdon, graced with kine and steeds,&#151;<br> Lead thou both these and us forward to higher bliss. With brave men in the assembly may we speak aloud.</p>
