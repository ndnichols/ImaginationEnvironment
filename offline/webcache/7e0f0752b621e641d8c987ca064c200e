<p>1. THE friends who offer Soma long to find thee: they pour forth Soma and present their viands.<br> They bear unmoved the cursing of the people, for all our wisdom comes from thee, O Indra.<br> 2 Not far for thee are mid-air's loftiest regions: start hither, Lord of Bays, with thy Bay Horses.<br> Made for the Firm and Strong are these libations. The pressing-stones are set and fire is kindled.<br> 3 Fair cheeks hath Indra, Maghavan, the Victor, Lord of a great host, Stormer, strong in action.<br> What once thou didst in might when mortals vexed thee,&#151;where now, O Bull, are those thy hero exploits?<br> 4 For, overthrowing what hath ne&#146;er been shaken, thou goest forth alone destroying V&#7771;tras.<br> For him who followeth thy Law the mountains and heaven and earth stand as if firmly stablished.<br> 5 Yea, Much-invoked! in safety through thy glories alone thou speakest truth as V&#7771;tra's slayer.<br> E&#146;en these two boundless worlds to thee, O Indra, what time thou graspest them, are but a handful.<br> 6 Forthwith thy Bay steeds down the steep, O Indra, forth, crushing foemen, go thy bolt of thunder!<br> Slay those who meet thee, those who flee, who follow: make all thy promise true; be all completed.<br> 7 The man to whom thou givest as Provider enjoys domestic plenty undivided.<br> Blest, Indra, is thy favour dropping fatness: thy worship, Much-invoked! brings gifts in thousands.<br> 8 Thou, Indra, Much-invoked! didst crush to pieces Kunaru handless fiend who dwelt with Danu.<br> Thou with might, Indra, smotest dead the scorner, the footless V&#7771;tra as he waxed in vigour.<br> 9 Thou hast established in her seat, O Indra, the level earth, vast, vigorous, unbounded.<br> The Bull hath propped the heaven and air's mid-region. By thee sent onward let the floods flow hither.<br> 10 He who withheld the kine, in silence I yielded in fear before thy blow, O Indra.<br> He made paths easy to drive forth the cattle. Loud-breathing praises helped the Much-invoked One.<br> 11 Indra alone filled full the earth and heaven, the Pair who meet together, rich in treasures.<br> Yea, bring thou near us from the air's mid-region strength, on thy car, and wholesome food, O Hero.<br> 12 S&#363;rya transgresses not the ordered limits set daily by the Lord of Tawny Coursers.<br> When to the goal he comes, his journey ended, his Steeds he looses: this is Indra's doing.<br> 13 Men gladly in the course of night would look on the broad bright front of the refulgent Morning;<br> And all acknowledge, when she comes in glory, the manifold and goodly works of Indra.<br> 14 A mighty splendour rests upon her bosom: bearing ripe milk the Cow, unripe, advances.<br> All sweetness is collected in the Heifer, sweetness which Indra made for our enjoyment.<br> 15 Barring the way they come. Be firm, O Indra; aid friends to sacrifice and him who singeth.<br> These must be slain by thee, malignant mortals, armed with ill arts, our quiverbearing foemen.<br> 16 A cry is beard from enemies most near us: against them send thy fiercest-flaming weapon.<br> Rend them from under, crush them and subdue them. Slay, Maghavan, and make the fiends our booty.<br> 17 Root up the race of R&#257;k&#7779;asas, O Indra rend it in front and crush it in the middle.<br> How long hast thou bebaved as one who wavers? Cast thy hot dart at him who hates devotion:<br> 18 When borne by strong Steeds for our weal, O Leader, thou seatest thee at many noble viands.<br> May we be winners of abundant riches. May Indra be our wealth with store of children.<br> 19 Bestow on us resplendent wealth. O Indra let us enjoy thine overflow of bounty.<br> Wide as a sea our longing hath expanded, fulfil it, O thou Treasure-Lord of treasures.<br> 20 With kine and horses satisfy this longing with very splendid bounty skill extend it.<br> Seeking the light, with hymns to thee, O Indra, Ku&#347;ikas have brought their gift, the singers.<br> 21 Lord of the kine, burst the kine's stable open: cows shall be ours, and strength that wins the booty.<br> Hero, whose might is true, thy home is heaven: to us, O Maghavan, grant gifts of cattle.<br> 22 Call we on Maghavan, auspicious Indra, best Hero in this fight where spoil is gathered,<br> The Strong who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the V&#7771;tras, wins and gathers riches.</p>
