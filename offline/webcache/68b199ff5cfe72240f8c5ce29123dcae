And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first   
day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto  
all that YHVH had given him in commandment unto them;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

YHVH our ELOHIYM spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in

Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto

Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

spoken is good for us to do.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>

the judgment is ELOHIYM's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it     
unto me, and I will hear it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>

And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible

And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before

we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>Notwithstanding 
ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of YHVH your

destroy us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The

heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Then I said unto you,

by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH heard the voice of your

</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>Save Caleb the

</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>Also YHVH was   
angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>But Joshua the

<TD><P>But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by   
the way of the Red sea.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against YHVH, we
