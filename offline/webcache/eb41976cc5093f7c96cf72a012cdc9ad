<TD><P>Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we    
should be called the sons of ELOHIYM: therefore the world knoweth us not,       
because it knew him not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>Beloved, now are we the sons of ELOHIYM, and it doth not yet appear 
what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; 
for we shall see him as he is.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>  
3</H4></TD><TD><P>And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself,   
even as he is pure.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the      
transgression of the law.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in    
him is no sin.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>
Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him,      
neither known him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is  
righteous, even as he is righteous.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8> 
<H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil     
sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of ELOHIYM was manifested, 
that he might destroy the works of the devil.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Whosoever is born of ELOHIYM doth not commit   
sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of    
ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>In  
this the children of ELOHIYM are manifest, and the children of the devil:       
whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of ELOHIYM, neither he that loveth not 
his brother.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>
For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love   
one another.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>
Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore    
slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Marvel not, my  
brethren, if the world hate you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14>   
<H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>We know that we have passed from death unto life,        
because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in         
death.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>      
Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath   
eternal life abiding in him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>   
16</H4></TD><TD><P>Hereby perceive we the love, because he laid down his life   
for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>But whoso hath this world's   
good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion 
from him, how dwelleth the love of ELOHIYM in him?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>My little children, let us not    
love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And hereby we know that we are of 
the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>For if our heart condemn us,      
ELOHIYM is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Beloved, if our heart condemn us  
not, then have we confidence toward ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him,       
because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his  
sight.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son YAHSHUA  
MASHIYACH, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And he that keepeth his       
commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth 
in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This
