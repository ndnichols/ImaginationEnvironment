prospereth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>   
For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that  
is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>

whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do   
well:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Because  
that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</P>

receiveth us not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating  
against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he     
himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them  
out of the church.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that  
doeth good is of ELOHIYM: but he that doeth evil hath not seen EL.</P></TD></TR>
