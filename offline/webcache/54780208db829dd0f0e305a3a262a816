<TD><P>And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the    
farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him again; and, as he was    
wont, he taught them again.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>

for a man to put away his wife? tempting him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And he answered and said unto them, What did   
Moses command you?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put 
her away.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
YAHSHUA answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote    
you this precept.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD>
<P>But from the beginning of the creation ELOHIYM made them male and female.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>For this cause    
shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife;</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And they twain shall be one 
flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>What therefore ELOHIYM hath joined  
together, let not man put asunder.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10> 
<H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And in the house his disciples asked him again of the    
same matter.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>
And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another,   
committeth adultery against her.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12>   
<H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be        
married to another, she committeth adultery.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And they brought young children to him, that he 
should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>But when YAHSHUA saw 
it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to   
come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of EL.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Verily I say unto    
you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of EL as a little child, he shall  
not enter therein.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed    
them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to     
him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal     
life?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
YAHSHUA said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one,    
that is, ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do   
not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and        
mother.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my        
youth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Then  
YAHSHUA beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go  
thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have   
treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And he was sad at that    
saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA looked round      
about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches     
enter into the kingdom of EL!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>  
24</H4></TD><TD><P>And the disciples were astonished at his words. But YAHSHUA  
answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that    
trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of EL!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>It is easier for a camel to go    
through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of   
EL.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And they 
were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be        
saved?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
YAHSHUA looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with        
ELOHIYM: for with EL all things are possible.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we     
have left all, and have followed thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA answered and said, Verily I say     
unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or     
father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the         
gospel's,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>   
But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and 
sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the    
world to come eternal life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>    
31</H4></TD><TD><P>But many that are first shall be last; and the last          
first.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and YAHSHUA went before them: and   
they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the 
twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>Saying, Behold, we go up  
to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and 
unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to 
the Gentiles:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and 
shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And James and John, the sons of   
Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us  
whatsoever we shall desire.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>    
36</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for    
you?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>They    
said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the    
other on thy left hand, in thy glory.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>But YAHSHUA said unto them, Ye know not what ye 
ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism  
that I am baptized with?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And they said unto him, We can. And YAHSHUA said unto them, Ye      
shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am   
baptized withal shall ye be baptized:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand 
is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the    
ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>But YAHSHUA called   
them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule 
over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise    
authority upon them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among 
you, shall be your minister:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>   
44</H4></TD><TD><P>And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant  
of all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P>For  
even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to     
give his life a ransom for many.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46>   
<H4>46</H4></TD><TD><P>And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho  
with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of   
Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V47><H4>47</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he heard that it was YAHSHUA of        
Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, YAHSHUA, thou son of David, have mercy  
on me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V48><H4>48</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great   
deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V49><H4>49</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA stood still, and commanded him to   
be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort,    
rise; he calleth thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V50><H4>50</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to YAHSHUA.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V51><H4>51</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA     
answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The      
blind man said unto him, ADONAY, that I might receive my sight.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V52><H4>52</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA said unto     
him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received    
his sight, and followed YAHSHUA in the way.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This
