<TD><P>There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans,  
whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA answering said unto     
them, Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans,   
because they suffered such things?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3>  
<H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all      
likewise perish.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think  
ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem?</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>I tell you, Nay: but,       
except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>He spake also this parable; A certain man had  
a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and   
found none.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come 
seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it    
the ground?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall 
dig about it, and dung it:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt  
cut it down.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>
And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And, behold, there was a      
woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together,   
and could in no wise lift up herself.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And when YAHSHUA saw her, he called her to him, 
and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And he laid his hands on  
her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And the ruler of the      
synagogue answered with indignation, because that YAHSHUA had healed on the     
sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to 
work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>The ADONAY then      
answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath 
loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And ought not this   
woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen   
years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he had said these        
things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all   
the glorious things that were done by him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of EL    
like? and whereunto shall I resemble it?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man 
took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the    
fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken   
the kingdom of EL?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, 
till the whole was leavened.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>   
22</H4></TD><TD><P>And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and   
journeying toward Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>   
23</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said one unto him, ADONAY, are there few that be saved? 
And he said unto them,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you,    
will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>When once the master of the house is risen   
up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at   
the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto    
you, I know you not whence ye are:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26> 
<H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in   
thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>But he shall say, I tell you, I   
know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>There shall be       
weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, 
and all the prophets, in the kingdom of EL, and you yourselves thrust out.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And they shall  
come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south,  
and shall sit down in the kingdom of EL.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And, behold, there are last which shall be      
first, and there are first which shall be last.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>The same day there came certain of the       
Pharisees, saying unto him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill 
thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And he 
said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do   
cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>Nevertheless I must  
walk to day, and to morrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a      
prophet perish out of Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34>   
<H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and  
stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy       
children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would 
not!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>Behold, 
your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not   
see me, until the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the 
name of YHVH.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John
