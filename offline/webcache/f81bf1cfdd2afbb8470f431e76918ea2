The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that YAHSHUA began both   
to do and teach,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost 
had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen:</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>To whom also he shewed himself  
alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty     
days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of EL:</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And, being assembled        
together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem,  
but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of       
me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>For John   
truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not     
many days hence.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, ADONAY,   
wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, It is    
not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his  
own power.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>But 
ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye      
shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in         
Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he had spoken these        
things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of     
their sight.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>
And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men   
stood by them in white apparel;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>
11</H4></TD><TD><P>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up   
into heaven? this same YAHSHUA, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall   
so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Then returned they unto Jerusalem 
from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's           
journey.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both       
Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and    
Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of 
James.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>These 
all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and   
Mary the mother of YAHSHUA, and with his brethren.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And in those days Peter stood up  
in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were     
about an hundred and twenty,)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>  
16</H4></TD><TD><P>Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been        
fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning   
Judas, which was guide to them that took YAHSHUA.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>For he was numbered with us, and  
had obtained part of this ministry.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18>
<H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Now this man purchased a field with the reward of        
iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his      
bowels gushed out.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that    
field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of  
blood.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>For   
it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no 
man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore of these men which have 
companied with us all the time that the ADONAY YAHSHUA went in and out among    
us,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>         
Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up     
from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And they        
appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and             
Matthias.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And they prayed, and said, Thou, YHVH, which knowest the hearts of all men,     
shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>That he may take part of this ministry and      
apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his    
own place.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was      
numbered with the eleven apostles.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
