And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue 
of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of  
the Greeks believed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds   
evil affected against the brethren.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3> 
<H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in YHVH,   
which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders  
to be done by their hands.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4>
</TD><TD><P>But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the   
Jews, and part with the apostles.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5>   
<H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles,  
and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone  
them,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>They     
were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto   
the region that lieth round about:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7>  
<H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And there they preached the gospel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And there sat a certain man at      
Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never 
had walked:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>   
The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he 
had faith to be healed,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped    
and walked.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying 
in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of      
men.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And     
they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief    
speaker.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and       
garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Which when the       
apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in      
among the people, crying out,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>  
15</H4></TD><TD><P>And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of 
like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these      
vanities unto the living EL, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all 
things that are therein:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own         
ways.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>       
Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave 
us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and     
gladness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not     
done sacrifice unto them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>      
19</H4></TD><TD><P>And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and         
Iconium, who persuaded the people, and having stoned Paul, drew him out of the  
city, supposing he had been dead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20>  
<H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose 
up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to       
Derbe.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they       
returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Confirming the souls of the       
disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must        
through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of EL.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they had ordained them   
elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to     
YHVH, on whom they believed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>   
24</H4></TD><TD><P>And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to   
Pamphylia.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia:</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And thence      
sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of        
ELOHIYM for the work which they fulfilled.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they were come, and had gathered the   
church together, they rehearsed all that ELOHIYM had done with them, and how he 
had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And there they abode long time with the      
disciples.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M.
