1</H4></TD><TD><P>The same day went YAHSHUA out of the house, and sat by the    
sea side.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship,  
and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And he spake many things unto them  
in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he sowed, some seeds fell  
by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Some fell upon stony places, where  
they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no      
deepness of earth:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no     
root, they withered away.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked    
them:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>But      
other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some 
sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>     
9</H4></TD><TD><P>Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And the disciples came, and said  
unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>He answered and said unto them,   
Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven,    
but to them it is not given.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>   
12</H4></TD><TD><P>For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have 
more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that  
he hath.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing 
they hear not, neither do they understand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of        
Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and    
seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>For this people's heart is waxed gross, and     
their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any    
time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and should       
understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal         
them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>But    
blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>For verily I say unto     
you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things      
which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear,   
and have not heard them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>When any one heareth the word of  
the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth 
away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the    
way side.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>   
But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth    
the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for 
a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by    
and by he is offended.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the  
word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the    
word, and he becometh unfruitful.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23>  
<H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>But he that received seed into the good ground is he     
that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and      
bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Another parable put he forth  
unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good 
seed in his field:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and 
went his way.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the 
tares also.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P> 
So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou  
sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>He said unto them, An enemy   
hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and       
gather them up?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD>
<P>But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the     
wheat with them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I   
will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in   
bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>Another parable put he forth unto 
them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a 
man took, and sowed in his field:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32>  
<H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is   
grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds   
of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>Another parable spake he unto     
them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in 
three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>All these things spake YAHSHUA    
unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto         
them:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>That   
it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my   
mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the     
foundation of the world.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Then YAHSHUA sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and  
his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares   
of the field.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of   
man;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>The     
field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the      
tares are the children of the wicked one;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the     
harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>As therefore the tares    
are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this          
world.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>The   
Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his        
kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>And shall cast them into a    
furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>Then shall the righteous      
shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear,   
let him hear.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which 
when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all     
that he hath, and buyeth that field.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a     
merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V46><H4>46</H4></TD><TD><P>Who, when he had found one pearl of great       
price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>47</H4></TD><TD><P>Again, the kingdom of heaven is   
like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V48><H4>48</H4></TD><TD><P>Which, when it  
was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, 
but cast the bad away.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V49><H4>49</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come       
forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V50><H4>50</H4></TD><TD><P>And shall cast them into the      
furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V51><H4>51</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA saith unto them, Have 
ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, ADONAY.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V52><H4>52</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said he unto them,   
Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like   
unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure     
things new and old.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V53><H4>53</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And it came to pass, that when YAHSHUA had finished these parables, he   
departed thence.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V54><H4>54</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their       
synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man   
this wisdom, and these mighty works?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V55><H4>55</H4></TD><TD><P>Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his     
mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and          
Judas?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V56><H4>56</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these      
things?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V57><H4>57</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
they were offended in him. But YAHSHUA said unto them, A prophet is not without 
honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V58><H4>58</H4></TD><TD><P>And he did not many mighty works  
there because of their unbelief.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
