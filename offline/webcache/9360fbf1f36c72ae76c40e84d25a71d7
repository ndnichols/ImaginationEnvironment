<p>1. ONE state begets another state: husk is made visible from husk:<br> Within his Mother's side he speaks.<br> 2 Discerning, have they offered gifts: they guard the strength that never wastes.<br> To a strong fort have they pressed in.<br> 3 &#346;vaitreya's people, all his men, have gloriously increased in might.<br> A gold chain B&#7771;haduktha wears, as, through this Soma, seeking spoil.<br> 4 I bring, as &#146;twere, the longed-for milk, the dear milk of the Sister-Pair.<br> Like to a caldron filled with food is he, unconquered, conquering all.<br> 5 Beam of light, come to us in sportive fashion, finding thyself close to the wind that fans thee.<br> These flames of his are wasting flames, like arrows keen-pointed, sharpened, on his breast.</p>
