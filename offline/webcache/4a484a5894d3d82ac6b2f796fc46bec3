<p>1 As &#146;twere Some goodly treasure M&#257;tari&#347;van brought, as a gift, the glorious Priest to Bh&#7771;gu,<br> Banner of sacrifice, the good Protector, child of two births, the swiftly moving envoy.<br> 2 Both Gods and men obey this Ruler's order, Gods who are worshipped, men who yearn and worship.<br> As Priest he takes his seat ere break of morning, House-Lord, adorable with men, Ordainer.<br> 3 May our fair praise, heart-born, most recent, reach him whose tongue, e&#146;en at his birth, is sweet as honey;<br> Whom mortal priests, men, with their strong endeavour, supplied with dainty viands, have created.<br> 4 Good to mankind, the yearning Purifier hath among men been placed as Priest choice-worthy.<br> May Agni be our Friend, Lord of the Household, protector of the riches in the dwelling.<br> 5 As such we Gotamas with hymns extol thee, O Agni, as the guardian Lord of riches,<br> Decking thee like a horse, the swift prizewinner. May he, enriched with prayer, come soon and early.</p>
