also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour,

nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and ELOHIYM doeth it,    
that men should fear before him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15>   
<H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>That which hath been is now; and that which is to be     
hath already been; and ELOHIYM requireth that which is past.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And moreover I saw under the  
sun the place of judgment, that wickedness was there; and the place of          
righteousness, that iniquity was there.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

every work.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P> 
I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that ELOHIYM     
might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are           
beasts.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>For  
that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth 
them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so   
that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.</P></TD></TR>

all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the       
earth?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>      
Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should       
rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to   
see what shall be after him?</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
