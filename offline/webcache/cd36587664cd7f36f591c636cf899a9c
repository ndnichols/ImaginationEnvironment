<p>1. I LAUD the seven-rayed, the triple-headed, Agni all-perfect in his Parents&#146; bosom,<br> Sunk in the lap of all that moves and moves not, him who hath filled all luminous realms of heaven.<br> 2 As a great Steer he grew to these his Parents; sublime he stands, untouched by eld, far-reaching.<br> He plants his footsteps on the lofty ridges of the broad earth: his red flames lick the udder.<br> 3 Coming together to their common youngling both Cows, fairshaped, spread forth in all directions,<br> Measuring out the paths that must be travelled, entrusting all desires to him the Mighty.<br> 4 The prudent sages lead him to his dwelling, guarding with varied skill the Ever-Youthful.<br> Longing, they turned their eyes unto the River: to these the Sun of men was manifested.<br> 5 Born noble in the regions, aim of all mens&#146; eyes to be implored for life by great and small alike,<br> Far as the Wealthy One hath spread himself abroad, he is the Sire all-visible of this progeny.</p>
