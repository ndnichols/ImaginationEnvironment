divorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors is it to whom I     
have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for     
your transgressions is your mother put away.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot   
redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I 
make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinketh, because there is no water,   
and dieth for thirst.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD>
