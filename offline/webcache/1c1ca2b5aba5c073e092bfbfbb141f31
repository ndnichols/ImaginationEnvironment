<TD><P>And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent   
to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought 
up Ahab's children, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>     
2</H4></TD><TD><P>Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your         
master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a       
fenced city also, and armor;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>    
3</H4></TD><TD><P>Look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and 
set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>But they were exceedingly   
afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we     
stand?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And he  
that was over the house, and he that was over the city, the elders also, and    
the bringers up of the children, sent to Jehu, saying, We are thy servants, and 
will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any king: do thou that     
which is good in thine eyes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>    
6</H4></TD><TD><P>Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye 
be mine, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the men     
your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time. Now the   
king's sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, which  
brought them up.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's 
sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him    
them to Jezreel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the      
heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entering 
in of the gate until the morning.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9>   
<H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and 
stood, and said to all the people, Ye be righteous: behold, I conspired against 
my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Know now that there shall fall    
unto the earth nothing of the word of YHVH, which YHVH spake concerning the     
house of Ahab: for YHVH hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>So Jehu slew    
all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and   
his kinsfolk, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And he arose and          
departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at the shearing house in the       
way,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Jehu    
met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are ye? And they  
answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the children 
of the king and the children of the queen.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, Take them alive. And they took     
them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty  
men; neither left he any of them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15>  
<H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab 
the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is   
thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It    
is. If it be, give me thine hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up  
to him into the chariot.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for YHVH. So they made   
him ride in his chariot.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab in 
Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of YHVH, which he   
spake to Elijah.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab      
served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Now therefore call unto me all    
the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be        
wanting: for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be         
wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent that he  
might destroy the worshippers of Baal.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for   
Baal. And they proclaimed it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>  
21</H4></TD><TD><P>And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of 
Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into   
the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said     
unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the            
worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the  
son of Rechab, into the house of Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal,   
Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of YHVH, but  
the worshippers of Baal only.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>  
24</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt          
offerings, Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men    
whom I have brought into your hands escape, he that letteth him go, his life    
shall be for the life of him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>  
25</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of        
offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains,   
Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of 
the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city   
of the house of Baal.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and     
burned them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>
And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the house of Baal, and    
made it a draught house unto this day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Howbeit from the     
sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not    
from after them, to wit, the golden calves that were in Bethel, and that were   
in Dan.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
YHVH said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing that which is     
right in mine eyes, and hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that  
was in mine heart, thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the       
throne of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of YHVH ELOHIYM of Israel with  
all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which made Israel 
to sin.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>In   
those days YHVH began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them in all the     
coasts of Israel;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the       
Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, even   
Gilead and Bashan.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his       
might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of       
Israel?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his   
son reigned in his stead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>      
36</H4></TD><TD><P>And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was    
twenty and eight years.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright
