<p>1. O AGNI, shared by all men living bring us good luck for sacrifice from earth and heaven.<br> With us be thine intelligence, WonderWorker! Protect us, God, with thy far-reaching blessings.<br> 2 These hymns brought forth for thee, O Agni, laud thee for bounteous gifts, with cattle and with horses.<br> Good Lord, when man from thee hath gained enjoyment, by hymns, O noblyborn, hath he obtained it.<br> 3 Agni I deem my Kinsman and my Father, count him my Brother and my Friend for ever.<br> I honour as the face of lofty Agni in heaven the bright and holy light of S&#363;rya.<br> 4 Effectual, Agni, are our prayers for profit. He whom, at home thou, Priest for ever, guardest<br> Is rich in food, drawn by red steeds, and holy: by day and night to him shall all be pleasant.<br> 5 Men with their arms have generated Agni, helpful as some kind friend, adorned with splendours,<br> And stablished as Invoker mid the people the ancient Priest the sacrifice's lover.<br> 6 Worship, thyself, O God, the Gods in heaven: what, void of knowledge, shall the fool avail thee?<br> As thou, O God, hast worshipped Gods by seasons, so, nobly-born! to thine own self pay worship.<br> 7 Agni, be thou our Guardian and Protector bestow upon us life and vital vigour.<br> Accept, O Mighty One, the gifts we offer, and with unceasing care protect our bodies.</p>
