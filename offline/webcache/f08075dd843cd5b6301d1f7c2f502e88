<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>And David consulted with the    
captains of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And David said unto all the         
congregation of Israel, If it seem good unto you, and that it be of YHVH our    
ELOHIYM, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, that are left in all 
the land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites which are in  
their cities and suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us:</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And let us bring again the  
ark of our ELOHIYM to us: for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And all the       
congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of 
all the people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the    
entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of ELOHIYM from Kirjathjearim.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And David went up, and 
all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjathjearim, which belonged to Judah, to   
bring up thence the ark of ELOHIYM YHVH, that dwelleth between the cherubim,    
whose name is called on it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>     
7</H4></TD><TD><P>And they carried the ark of ELOHIYM in a new cart out of the  
house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And David and all Israel played     
before ELOHIYM with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with 
psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they came     
unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for 
the oxen stumbled.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And the anger of YHVH was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him,        
because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before ELOHIYM.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And David was        
displeased, because YHVH had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is   
called Perezuzza to this day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>  
12</H4></TD><TD><P>And David was afraid of ELOHIYM that day, saying, How shall  
I bring the ark of ELOHIYM home to me?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the          
Gittite.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
the ark of ELOHIYM remained with the family of Obededom in his house three      
months. And YHVH blessed the house of Obededom, and all that he had.</P></TD>
