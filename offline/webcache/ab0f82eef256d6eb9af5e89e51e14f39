NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>And there was a famine in the land, beside the    
first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech     
king of the Philistines unto Gerar.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2> 
<H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into    
Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Sojourn in this land, and I will be 
with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give   
all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy 
father;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And I  
will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy   
seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be 
blessed;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>      
Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my   
statutes, and my laws.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And the men of the place asked him of his wife;   
and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said 
he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to    
look upon.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the 
Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting    
with Rebekah his wife.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is    
thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him,       
Because I said, Lest I die for her.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10>
<H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? 
one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest     
have brought guiltiness upon us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11>   
<H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that    
toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Isaac sowed in that      
land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and YHVH blessed him.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And the man     
waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>For he had           
possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and 
the Philistines envied him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>    
15</H4></TD><TD><P>For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in  
the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled    
them with earth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier    
than we.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt   
there.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of     
Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of     
Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had      
called them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>
And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing  
water.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is      
ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And they digged 
another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And he removed  
from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he      
called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now YHVH hath made room for    
us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And he went up from thence to Beersheba.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH        
appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the ELOHIYM of Abraham thy     
father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy     
seed for my servant Abraham's sake.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25>
<H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name  
of YHVH, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a        
well.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>Then   
Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol  
the chief captain of his army.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4> 
27</H4></TD><TD><P>And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye 
hate me, and have sent me away from you?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And they said, We saw certainly that YHVH was   
with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us    
and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not 
touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent     
thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And he made them a feast, and     
they did eat and drink.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another:

<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass the same  
day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they
