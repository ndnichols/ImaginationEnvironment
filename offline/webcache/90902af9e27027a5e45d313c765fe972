may abound?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Know ye not, that so   
many of us as were baptized into YAHSHUA MASHIYACH were baptized into his       
death?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>        
Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as MASHIYACH  
was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should  
walk in newness of life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death,  
we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Knowing this, that our old man is   
crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we 
should not serve sin.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD>
<TD><P>For he that is dead is freed from sin.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Now if we be dead with MASHIYACH, we believe   
that we shall also live with him:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9>   
<H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Knowing that MASHIYACH being raised from the dead dieth   
no more; death hath no more dominion over him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>For in that he died, he died unto sin once:  
but in that he liveth, he liveth unto ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be     
dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto ELOHIYM through YAHSHUA MASHIYACH our      
ADONAY.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Let  
not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the      
lusts thereof.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin:    
but yield yourselves unto ELOHIYM, as those that are alive from the dead, and   
your members as instruments of righteousness unto ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>For sin shall not have dominion   
over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>What then? shall we sin, because  
we are not under the law, but under grace? Forbid.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Know ye not, that to whom ye      
yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether 
of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>But ELOHIYM be thanked, that ye   
were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of        
doctrine which was delivered you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18>  
<H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of 
righteousness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for  
as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto    
iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto         
holiness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>   
For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>What fruit had ye    
then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is 
death.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>But   
now being made free from sin, and become servants to ELOHIYM, ye have your      
fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>For the wages of sin is death;    
but the gift of ELOHIYM is eternal life through YAHSHUA MASHIYACH our           
ADONAY.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John M.
