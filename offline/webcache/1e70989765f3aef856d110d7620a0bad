himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to ELOHIYM for a sweetsmelling       
savour.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>But    
fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named     
among you, as becometh saints;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>

</TD><TD><P>Be not ye therefore partakers with them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>For it is a     
shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>But all things that  
are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest  
is light.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and

<H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but

Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore be ye not unwise, but              
understanding what the will of the ADONAY is.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>

Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Wives, submit yourselves unto 
your own husbands, as unto the ADONAY.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>For the husband is the head of the wife, even   
as MASHIYACH is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore as    
the church is subject unto MASHIYACH, so let the wives be to their own husbands 
in every thing.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD>
<P>Husbands, love your wives, even as MASHIYACH also loved the church, and gave 
himself for it;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD>
<P>That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the       
word,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>That   
he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle,  
or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>So ought men to love      
their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>For no man ever 
yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the ADONAY   
the church:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P> 
For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>For this cause shall a    
man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they    
two shall be one flesh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning MASHIYACH and the   
church.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>     
Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as        
himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
