And David perceived that YHVH had confirmed him king over Israel, for his       
kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR>

when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all    
the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard of it, and went out      
against them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>

deliver them into thine hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>

Baalperazim.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>

it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry
