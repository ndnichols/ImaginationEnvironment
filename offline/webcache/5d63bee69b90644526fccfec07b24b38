1</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore, thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say,    
Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, the chief prince  
of Meshech and Tubal:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And I will turn thee back, and leave but the sixth part of thee, and     
will cause thee to come up from the north parts, and will bring thee upon the   
mountains of Israel:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause thine      
arrows to fall out of thy right hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel,     
thou, and all thy bands, and the people that is with thee: I will give thee     
unto the ravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of the field to be     
devoured.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou 
shalt fall upon the open field: for I have spoken it, saith the ADONAY YHVH.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will send a 
fire on Magog, and among them that dwell carelessly in the isles: and they      
shall know that I am YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4>
</TD><TD><P>So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel; 
and I will not let them pollute my holy name any more: and the heathen shall    
know that I am YHVH, the Holy One in Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the     
ADONAY YHVH; this is the day whereof I have spoken.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And they that dwell in the cities   
of Israel shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the  
shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves, and the  
spears, and they shall burn them with fire seven years:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>So that they shall take no wood   
out of the field, neither cut down any out of the forests; for they shall burn  
the weapons with fire: and they shall spoil those that spoiled them, and rob    
those that robbed them, saith the ADONAY YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And it shall come to pass in that day, that  
I will give unto Gog a place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the       
passengers on the east of the sea: and it shall stop the noses of the           
passengers: and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude: and they shall 
call it The valley of Hamongog.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>
12</H4></TD><TD><P>And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of     
them, that they may cleanse the land.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Yea, all the people of the land shall bury      
them; and it shall be to them a renown the day that I shall be glorified, saith 
the ADONAY YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And they shall sever out men of continual employment, passing through    
the land to bury with the passengers those that remain upon the face of the     
earth, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall they search.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And the passengers   
that pass through the land, when any seeth a man's bone, then shall he set up a 
sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamongog.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And also the name of 
the city shall be Hamonah. Thus shall they cleanse the land.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And, thou son of man, thus    
saith the ADONAY YHVH; Speak unto every feathered fowl, and to every beast of   
the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my 
sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the          
mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh, and drink blood.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye shall eat the flesh of the 
mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and 
of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And ye shall eat fat till ye be   
full, and drink blood till ye be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have          
sacrificed for you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with       
mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the ADONAY YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will set my glory among 
the heathen, and all the heathen shall see my judgment that I have executed,    
and my hand that I have laid upon them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>So the house of Israel shall know that I am     
YHVH their ELOHIYM from that day and forward.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And the heathen shall know that the house of 
Israel went into captivity for their iniquity: because they trespassed against  
me, therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the hand of their     
enemies: so fell they all by the sword.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>According to their uncleanness and according to 
their transgressions have I done unto them, and hid my face from them.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore thus saith 
the ADONAY YHVH; Now will I bring again the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy  
upon the whole house of Israel, and will be jealous for my holy name;</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>After that they have 
borne their shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed        
against me, when they dwelt safely in their land, and none made them afraid.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>When I have     
brought them again from the people, and gathered them out of their enemies'     
lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations;</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Then shall they know that I   
am YHVH their ELOHIYM, which caused them to be led into captivity among the     
heathen: but I have gathered them unto their own land, and have left none of    
them any more there.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured   
out my spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the ADONAY YHVH.</P></TD></TR>
