1</H4></TD><TD><P>Again the word of YHVH came unto me, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Son of man, speak to the        
children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land,  
if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their     
watchman:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>If   
when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the   
people;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Then   
whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the      
sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>He heard the sound of  
the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that     
taketh warning shall deliver his soul.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow  
not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take any  
person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I  
require at the watchman's hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4> 
7</H4></TD><TD><P>So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the    
house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them  
from me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>When  
I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not    
speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his         
iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Nevertheless, if thou warn the      
wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die 
in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore, O thou son of man,     
speak unto the house of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions    
and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live?</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Say unto them,  
As I live, saith the ADONAY YHVH, I have no pleasure in the death of the        
wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from   
your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore, thou son of man, say   
unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not   
deliver him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the       
wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his           
wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness   
in the day that he sinneth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>    
13</H4></TD><TD><P>When I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely      
live; if he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his        
righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he hath      
committed, he shall die for it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>
14</H4></TD><TD><P>Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if 
he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>If the wicked restore the     
pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without    
committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>None of his sins that he hath 
committed shall be mentioned unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and    
right; he shall surely live.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>   
17</H4></TD><TD><P>Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the ADONAY is 
not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>When the righteous turneth from   
his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>But if the wicked    
turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live  
thereby.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Yet 
ye say, The way of the ADONAY is not equal. O ye house of Israel, I will judge  
you every one after his ways.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>  
21</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in 
the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out   
of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Now the hand of YHVH was upon me  
in the evening, afore he that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until  
he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more        
dumb.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Then   
the word of YHVH came unto me, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of   
the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land:   
but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore say unto them, Thus     
saith the ADONAY YHVH; Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your 
idols, and shed blood: and shall ye possess the land?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye stand upon your sword, ye work 
abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbour's wife: and shall ye possess 
the land?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH; As I live, surely they     
that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and him that is in the open     
field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that be in the forts   
and in the caves shall die of the pestilence.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>For I will lay the land most desolate, and   
the pomp of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be      
desolate, that none shall pass through.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Then shall they know that I am YHVH, when I     
have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they   
have committed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD>
<P>Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are talking against  
thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another,     
every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word   
that cometh forth from YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>   
31</H4></TD><TD><P>And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit   
before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them:   
for with their mouth they shew much love, but their heart goeth after their     
covetousness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a         
pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they hear thy words,    
but they do them not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall they   
know that a prophet hath been among them.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This
