</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>For as touching   
the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>For I know the    
forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that   
Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Yet have I sent the    
brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I 
said, ye may be ready:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you          
unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident   
boasting.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>     
Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go     
before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice      
before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of      
covetousness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P> 
But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he     
which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Every man according as he purposeth 
in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for ELOHIYM     
loveth a cheerful giver.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And ELOHIYM is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye,   
always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>(As it is         
written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness 
remaineth for ever.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your   
food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your              
righteousness;)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD>
<P>Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us 
thanksgiving to ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4>
</TD><TD><P>For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want  
of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto ELOHIYM;</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Whiles by the        
experiment of this ministration they glorify ELOHIYM for your professed         
subjection unto the gospel of MASHIYACH, and for your liberal distribution unto 
them, and unto all men;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding 
grace of ELOHIYM in you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Thanks be unto ELOHIYM for his unspeakable gift.</P></TD></TR>
