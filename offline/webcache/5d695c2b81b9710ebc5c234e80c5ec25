Chapter 3</H1></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the        
Jews:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>The same 
came to YAHSHUA by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a     
teacher come from ELOHIYM: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest,    
except EL be with him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto      
thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of EL.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Nicodemus saith unto him,   
How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his     
mother's womb, and be born?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>     
5</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a   
man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of     
EL.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>That which 
is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is          
spirit.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Marvel 
not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>The wind bloweth where it listeth,  
and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and    
whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Nicodemus answered and said     
unto him, How can these things be?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10> 
<H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of 
Israel, and knowest not these things?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that  
we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>If I have told  
you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of  
heavenly things?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from        
heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the    
wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>That whosoever believeth in him   
should not perish, but have eternal life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>For ELOHIYM so loved the world, that he gave    
his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but   
have everlasting life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>For ELOHIYM sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world;   
but that the world through him might be saved.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>He that believeth on him is not condemned:   
but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in 
the name of the only begotten Son of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And this is the condemnation, that light is  
come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their    
deeds were evil.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the    
light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>But he that doeth truth cometh to the light,    
that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in ELOHIYM.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>After these things   
came YAHSHUA and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried    
with them, and baptized.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there   
was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>For John was not yet cast into    
prison.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Then 
there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about      
purifying.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond 
Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men    
come to him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>
John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from  
heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye   
yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the MASHIYACH, but that I am  
sent before him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the          
bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the    
bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>He must increase, but I must      
decrease.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>He 
that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and    
speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And what he hath seen and 
heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>He that hath received his     
testimony hath set to his seal that ELOHIYM is true.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>For he whom ELOHIYM hath sent     
speaketh the words of EL: for EL giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>The Father      
loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>He that believeth on the Son hath 
everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the 
wrath of ELOHIYM abideth on him.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
