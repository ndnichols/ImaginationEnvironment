Chapter 19</H1></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And YAHSHUA entered and passed through Jericho.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And, behold, there was a man named  
Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And he sought to see   
YAHSHUA who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of       
stature.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to    
pass that way.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>
And when YAHSHUA came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto    
him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy       
house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And he  
made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they saw it, they all      
murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And Zacchaeus     
stood, and said unto the ADONAY: Behold, ADONAY, the half of my goods I give to 
the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I     
restore him fourfold.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And YAHSHUA said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house,     
forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>For the Son of man is come to seek and to save  
that which was lost.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable,       
because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of  
EL should immediately appear.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>  
12</H4></TD><TD><P>He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far        
country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And he called his ten servants,   
and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>But his citizens     
hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to   
reign over us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, 
then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given    
the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Then came the first, 
saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto him, Well, thou good        
servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority  
over ten cities.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said     
likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here 
is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>For I feared thee, because thou   
art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that 
thou didst not sow.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou    
wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid   
not down, and reaping that I did not sow:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into    
the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury?</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto     
them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten   
pounds.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>(And 
they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>For I say unto you, That unto every one      
which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall  
be taken away from him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over    
them, bring hither, and slay them before me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he had thus spoken, he went before,    
ascending up to Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>     
29</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and  
Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his            
disciples,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which at your entering  
ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him  
hither.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, Because    
the ADONAY hath need of him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>   
32</H4></TD><TD><P>And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he 
had said unto them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them,    
Why loose ye the colt?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And they said, The ADONAY hath need of him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And they brought him to YAHSHUA:  
and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set YAHSHUA thereon.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>And as he went, 
they spread their clothes in the way.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he was come nigh, even now at the      
descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to   
rejoice and praise ELOHIYM with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they 
had seen;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of YHVH: peace in heaven,   
and glory in the highest.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>      
39</H4></TD><TD><P>And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto 
him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40> 
<H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if  
these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he was come 
near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at      
least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are 
hid from thine eyes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a  
trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>And shall lay   
thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not     
leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy  
visitation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and  
them that bought;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46><H4>46</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye 
have made it a den of thieves.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4> 
47</H4></TD><TD><P>And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and 
the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V48><H4>48</H4></TD><TD><P>And could not find what they  
might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.</P></TD></TR>
