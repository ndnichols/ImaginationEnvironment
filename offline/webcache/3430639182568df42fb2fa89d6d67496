YAHSHUA,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead;    
and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>For Herod had laid hold on      
John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother      
Philip's wife.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>
For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he would have put him  
to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>But when Herod's  
birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased     
Herod.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>        
Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And she, being    
before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a    
charger.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with   
him at meat, he commanded it to be given her.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And he sent, and beheaded John in the        
prison.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it  
to her mother.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and    
told YAHSHUA.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>When YAHSHUA heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place     
apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of  
the cities.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And YAHSHUA went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with           
compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And when it was evening, his      
disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now      
past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy      
themselves victuals.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>But YAHSHUA said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to   
eat.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And     
they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>He said, Bring them       
hither to me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five   
loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake,    
and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And they did    
all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained       
twelve baskets full.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women  
and children.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And straightway YAHSHUA constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to 
go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he had sent 
the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the     
evening was come, he was there alone.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>But the ship was now in the midst of the sea,   
tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And in the fourth watch of the night YAHSHUA 
went unto them, walking on the sea.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26>
<H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they  
were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>But straightway      
YAHSHUA spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And Peter       
answered him and said, ADONAY, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the      
water.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the   
water, to go to YAHSHUA.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4>
</TD><TD><P>But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning   
to sink, he cried, saying, ADONAY, save me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And immediately YAHSHUA stretched forth his     
hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore      
didst thou doubt?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>Then they that were in the    
ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of            
ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the men of that  
place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about,    
and brought unto him all that were diseased;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>And besought him that they might only touch the 
hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.</P></TD>
