<p>1. I SEND you forth the song of praise for Indu, hero-gladdener.<br> With hymn and plenty he invites you to complete the sacrifice.<br> 2 Thou wishest for thy kine a bull, for those who long for his approach,<br> For those who turn away from him, lord of thy cows whom none may kill.<br> 3 The dappled kine who stream with milk prepare his draught of Soma juice:<br> Clans in the birth-place of the Gods, in the three luminous realms of heaven.<br> 4 Praise, even as he is known, with song Indra the guardian of the kine,<br> The Son of Truth, Lord of the brave.<br> 5 Hither his Bay Steeds have been sent, red Steeds are on the sacred grass,,<br> Where we in concert sing our songs.<br> 6 For Indra Thunder-armed the kine have yielded mingled milk and meath,<br> What time he found them in the vault.<br> 7 When I and Indra mount on high up to the Bright One's place and home,<br> We, having drunk of meath, will reach his seat whose Friends are three times seven.<br> 8 Sing, sing ye forth your songs of praise, ye Briyamedhas, sing your songs:<br> Yea, let young children sing their lauds as a strong castle praise ye him.<br> 9 Now loudly let the viol sound, the lute send out its voice with might,<br> Shrill be, the music of the string. To Indra. is the hymn up-raised.<br> 10 When hither speed the dappled cows, unflinching, easy to be milked,<br> Seize quickly, as it bursts away, the Soma juice for Indra's drink.<br> 11 Indra hath drunk, Agni hath drunk. all Deities have drunk their fill.<br> Here Varu&#7751;a shall have his home, to whom the floods have sung aloud as mother-kine unto their calves.<br> 12 Thou, Varu&#7751;a, to whom belong Seven Rivers, art a glorious God.<br> The waters flow into thy throat as &#146;twere a pipe with ample mouth.<br> 13 He who hath made the fleet steeds spring, well-harnessed, to the worshipper,<br> He, the swift Guide, is that fair form that loosed the horses near at hand.<br> 14 Indra, the very Mighty, holds his enemies in utter scorn.<br> He, far away, and yet a child, cleft the cloud smitten by his voice.<br> 15 He, yet a boy exceeding small, mounted his newly-fashioned car.<br> He for his Mother and his Sire cooked the wild mighty buffalo.<br> 16 Lord of the home, fair-helmeted, ascend thy chariot wrought of gold.<br> We will attend the Heavenly One, the thousand-footed, red of hue, matchless, who blesses where he goes.<br> 17 With reverence they come hitherward to him as to. a Sovran lord,<br> That they may bring him near for this man's good success, to prosper and bestow his gifts.<br> 18 The Priyamedhas have observed the offering of the men of old,<br> Of ancient custom, while they strewed the sacred grass, and spread their sacrificial food.</p>
