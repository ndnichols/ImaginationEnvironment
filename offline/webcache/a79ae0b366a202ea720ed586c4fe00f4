<TD><P>At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And Jeroboam said to his wife,      
Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife 
of Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, which 
told me that I should be king over this people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels,  
and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of    
the child.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of 
Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his        
age.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And YHVH  
said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee    
for her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt thou say unto her: for it      
shall be, when she cometh in, that she shall feign herself to be another        
woman.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And it  
was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door,    
that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be   
another? for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith YHVH  
ELOHIYM of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made  
thee prince over my people Israel,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8>  
<H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and    
gave it thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my       
commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was 
right in mine eyes;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast gone   
and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast   
cast me behind thy back:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam,    
and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall, and him that  
is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the remnant of the house of   
Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung, till it be all gone.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the 
city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the 
air eat: for YHVH hath spoken it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12>  
<H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and   
when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And all Israel shall mourn for    
him, and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in  
him there is found some good thing toward YHVH ELOHIYM of Israel in the house   
of Jeroboam.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>
Moreover YHVH shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the      
house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>For YHVH shall smite Israel, as a reed is    
shaken in the water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which   
he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they 
have made their groves, provoking YHVH to anger.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And he shall give Israel up       
because of the sins of Jeroboam, who did sin, and who made Israel to sin.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And Jeroboam's  
wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and when she came to the          
threshold of the door, the child died;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for 
him, according to the word of YHVH, which he spake by the hand of his servant   
Ahijah the prophet.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, 
behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of          
Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with    
his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And Rehoboam the son of Solomon   
reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign,  
and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which YHVH did choose out 
of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was   
Naamah an Ammonitess.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And Judah did evil in the sight of YHVH, and they provoked him to   
jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers 
had done.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>   
For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high     
hill, and under every green tree.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24>  
<H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did  
according to all the abominations of the nations which YHVH cast out before the 
children of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak     
king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And he took away the treasures of the house of  
YHVH, and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all: and he took 
away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And king Rehoboam made in their   
stead brazen shields, and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the     
guard, which kept the door of the king's house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And it was so, when the king went into the   
house of YHVH, that the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard   
chamber.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Now 
the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in  
the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And there was war between         
Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was    
buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother's name was Naamah  
an Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
