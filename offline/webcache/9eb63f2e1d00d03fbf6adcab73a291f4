<p>1. STREAM on us riches that are sought by many, best at winning strength<br> Riches, O Indu, thousandfold, glorious, conquering the great.<br> 2 Effused, he hath, as on a car, invested him in fleecy mail:<br> Onward hath Indu flowed in streams, impelled, surrounded by the wood.<br> 3 Effused, this Indu hath flowed on, distilling rapture, to the fleece:<br> He goes erect, as seeking kine in stream, with light, to sacrifice.<br> 4 For thou thyself, O Indu, God, to every mortal worshipper<br> Attractest riches thousandfold, made manifest in hundred forms.<br> 5 Good V&#7771;tra-slayer, may we be still nearest to this wealth of thine<br> Which many crave, nearest to food and happiness, Resistless One!<br> 6 Whom, bright with native splendour, crushed between the pair of pressingstones-<br> The wavy Friend whom Indra loves-the twice-five sisters dip and bathe,<br> 7 Him with the fleece they purify, brown, golden-hued, beloved of all,<br> Who with exhilarating juice goes forth to all the Deities.<br> 8 Through longing for this sap of yours ye drink what brings ability,<br> Even him who, dear as heaven's own light, gives to our princes high renown.<br> 9 Indu at holy rites produced you, Heaven and Earth, the Friends of men,<br> Hill-haunting God the Goddesses. They bruised him where the roar was loud.<br> 10 For V&#7771;tra-slaying Indra, thou, Soma, art poured that he may drink,<br> Poured for the guerdon-giving man, poured for the God who sitteth there.<br> 11 These ancient Somas, at the break of day, have flowed into the sieve,<br> Snorting away at early morn these foolish evil-hearted ones.<br> 12 Friends, may the princes, ye and we, obtain this Most Resplendent One.<br> Gain him who hath the smell of strength, win him whose home is very strength.</p>
