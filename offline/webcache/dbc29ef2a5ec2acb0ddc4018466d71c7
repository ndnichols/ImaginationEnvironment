<TD><P>In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the ADONAY sitting upon a   
throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Above it stood the seraphims:   
each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he       
covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, 
holy, is YHVH of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And the posts of the door moved 
at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said I, Woe is    
me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the     
midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, YHVH of    
hosts.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Then    
flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had 
taken with the tongs from off the altar:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this  
hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Also I heard the  
voice of the ADONAY, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then    
said I, Here am I; send me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>     
9</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but    
understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Make the heart of this people     
fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their   
eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert,   
and be healed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>Then said I, ADONAY, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted   
without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly         
desolate,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>   
And YHVH have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst 
of the land.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>
But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a   
teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their      
leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
