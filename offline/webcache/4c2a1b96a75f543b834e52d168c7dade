<p>1. NOW Mitra-Varu&#7751;a shall be exalted high by your songs, noblest of all existing;<br> They who, as &#146;twere with reins are best Controllers, unequalled with their arms to check the people.<br> 2 To you Two Gods is this my thought extended, turned to the sacred grass with loving homage.<br> Give us, O Mitra-Varu&#7751;a, a dwelling safe from attack, which ye shall guard, Boon-Givers!<br> 3 Come hither, Mitra-Varu&#7751;a, invited with eulogies and loving adoration,<br> Ye who with your might, as Work-Controllers, urge even men who quickly hear to labour.<br> 4 Whom, of pure origin, like two strong horses, Aditi bore as babes in proper season,<br> Whom, Mighty at your birth, the Mighty Goddess brought forth as terrors to the mortal foeman.<br> 5 As all the Gods in their great joy and gladness gave you with one accord your high dominion,<br> As ye surround both worlds, though wide and spacious your spies are ever true and never bewildered.<br> 6 So, through the days maintaining princely power. ye prop the height as &#146;twere from loftiest heaven.<br> The Star of all the Gods, established, filleth the heaven and earth with food of man who liveth.<br> 7 Take the strong drink, to quaff till ye are sated, when he and his attendants fill the chamber.<br> The young Maids brook not that none seeks to win them, when, Quickeners of all! they scatter moisture.<br> 8 So with your tongue come ever, when your envoy, faithful and very wise, attends our worship.<br> Nourished by holy oil! he this yGur glory: annihilate the sacrificer's trouble.<br> 9 When, Mitra-Varu&#7751;a, they strive against you and break tlie friendly laws ye have established,<br> They, neither Gods nor men in estimation, like Api's sons have godless sacrifices.<br> 10 When singers in their song uplift their voices, some chant the Nivid texts with steady purpose.<br> Then may we sing you lauds that shall be fruitful: dp ye not rival all the Gods in greatness?<br> 11 O Mitra-Varu&#7751;a, may your large bounty come to us hither, near to this our dwelling,<br> When the kine haste to us, and when they harness the fleet-foot mettled stallion for the battle.</p>
