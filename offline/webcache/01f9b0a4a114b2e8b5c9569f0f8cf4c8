Chapter 18</H1></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>When YAHSHUA had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples    
over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his   
disciples.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for YAHSHUA ofttimes resorted   
thither with his disciples.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>     
3</H4></TD><TD><P>Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from   
the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and   
weapons.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>      
YAHSHUA therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth,    
and said unto them, Whom seek ye?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5>   
<H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>They answered him, YAHSHUA of Nazareth. YAHSHUA saith     
unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>As soon then as   
he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Then asked he     
them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, YAHSHUA of Nazareth.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA answered, I have told   
you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>That the saying might be    
fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Simon      
Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off  
his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said YAHSHUA unto Peter, Put up thy     
sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink 
it?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the 
band and the captain and officers of the Jews took YAHSHUA, and bound him,</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And led him     
away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high   
priest that same year.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was    
expedient that one man should die for the people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And Simon Peter followed YAHSHUA, 
and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and  
went in with YAHSHUA into the palace of the high priest.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>But Peter stood at the door       
without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high       
priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Then saith the       
damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's       
disciples? He saith, I am not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4> 
18</H4></TD><TD><P>And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a    
fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood     
with them, and warmed himself.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4> 
19</H4></TD><TD><P>The high priest then asked YAHSHUA of his disciples, and of  
his doctrine.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>YAHSHUA answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the      
synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret     
have I said nothing.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto  
them: behold, they know what I said.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he had thus spoken, one of the         
officers which stood by struck YAHSHUA with the palm of his hand, saying,       
Answerest thou the high priest so?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23> 
<H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear        
witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Now Annas had sent him bound unto 
Caiaphas the high priest.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>      
25</H4></TD><TD><P>And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said          
therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and   
said, I am not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD>
<P>One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter    
cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>Peter then denied again: and      
immediately the cock crew.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>     
28</H4></TD><TD><P>Then led they YAHSHUA from Caiaphas unto the hall of         
judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment      
hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Pilate then     
went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>They answered   
and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him 
up unto thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your     
law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man   
to death:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>   
That the saying of YAHSHUA might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what  
death he should die.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called        
YAHSHUA, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>YAHSHUA answered him, Sayest thou 
this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>Pilate answered, Am I a Jew?      
Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast   
thou done?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>  
YAHSHUA answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this   
world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the      
Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king 
then? YAHSHUA answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born,   
and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the   
truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>Pilate saith unto him, What is    
truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith    
unto them, I find in him no fault at all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>But ye have a custom, that I should release     
unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the     
King of the Jews?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now       
Barabbas was a robber.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000
