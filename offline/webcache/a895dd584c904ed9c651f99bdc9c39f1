1</H4></TD><TD><P>I say then, Hath YHVH cast away his people? Forbid. For I     
also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>ELOHIYM hath not cast  
away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of       
Elias? how he maketh intercession to EL against Israel saying,</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>YHVH ADONAY, they have killed   
thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek  
my life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>But   
what saith the answer unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men,   
who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Even so then at this present time   
also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And if by grace, then is it no  
more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it 
is no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>What then? Israel hath not obtained 
that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were 
blinded.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>      
(According as it is written, YHVH hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes   
that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this        
day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And David 
saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a 
recompence unto them:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down     
their back alway.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? Forbid: but rather 
through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to  
jealousy.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them 
the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>For I speak to you Gentiles,      
inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>If by any means I    
may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of        
them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>For if 
the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the        
receiving of them be, but life from the dead?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is   
also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And if some of the branches be    
broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and  
with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Boast not against the         
branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou wilt say   
then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Well; because of unbelief 
they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but        
fear:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>For if 
ELOHIYM spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not       
thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Behold 
therefore the goodness and severity of ELOHIYM: on them which fell, severity;   
but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou     
also shalt be cut off.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be        
graffed in: for ELOHIYM is able to graff them in again.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>For if thou wert cut out of the   
olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a  
good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be   
graffed into their own olive tree?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25> 
<H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of 
this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in    
part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And so all      
Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the       
Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>For this is my covenant unto      
them, when I shall take away their sins.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for  
your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the father's     
sakes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>For   
the gifts and calling of ELOHIYM are without repentance.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>For as ye in times past have not  
believed ELOHIYM, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>Even so have these   
also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>For ELOHIYM     
hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>O the depth of the   
riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of ELOHIYM! how unsearchable are his    
judgments, and his ways past finding out!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>For who hath known the mind of YHVH? or who     
hath been his counsellor?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>      
35</H4></TD><TD><P>Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed  
unto him again?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD>
<P>For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory    
for ever. Amen.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by
