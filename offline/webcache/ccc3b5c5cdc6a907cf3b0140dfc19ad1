<p>1. WE call on thee, O Matchless One! We seeking help, possessing nothing firm ourselves,<br> Call on thee wonderful in fight<br> 2 On thee for aid in sacrifice. This youth of ours, the bold, the mighty, hath gonse forth.<br> We therefore, we thy friends, Indra, havie chosen thee, free-giver, as our Guardian God.<br> 3 Come hither, for the drops are here, O Lord of corn-lands. Lord of horses, Lord of kine:<br> Drink thou the Soma, Soma's Lord!<br> 4 For we the kinless singers have drawn hither thee, O Indra, who hast numerous kin.<br> With all the forms thou hast, comic thou of bull-like strength, come near to drink the Soma juice.<br> 5 Sitting like birds beside thy meath., mingled with milk, that gladdeneth and exalteth thee,<br> Indra, to thee we sing aloud.<br> 6 We speak to thee with this our reverential prayer. Why art thou pondering yet awhile?<br> Here are our wishes; thou art liberal, Lord of Bays: we and our hymns are present here.<br> 7 For not in recent times alone, O Indra, Thunder-armed, have we obtained thine aid.<br> Of old we knew thy plenteous wealth.<br> 8 Hero, we knew thy friendship and thy rich rewards: these, Thunderer, now we crave of thee.<br> O Vasu, for all wealth that cometh of the kine, sharpen our powers, fair-visored God.<br> 9 Him who of old hath brought to us this and that blessing, him I magnify for you,<br> Even Indra, O my friends, for help<br> 10 Borne by Bay Steeds, the Lord of heroes, ruling men, for it is he who takes; delight.<br> May Maghavan bestow on us his worshippers hundreds of cattle and of steeds.<br> 11 Hero, may we, with thee for Friend, withstand the man who pants against us in his wrath,<br> In fight with people rich in kine.<br> 12 May we be victors in the singer's battlesong, and meet the wicked, Much invoked!<br> With heroes smite the foeman and show forth our strength. O Indra, further thou our thoughts.<br> 13 O Indra, from all ancient time rivalless ever and companionless art thou:<br> Thou seekest comradeship in war.<br> 14 Thou findest not the wealthy man to be thy friend: those scorn thee who are flown with wine.<br> What time thou thunderest and gatherest, then thou, even as a Father, art invoked.<br> 15 O Indra, let us not, like fools who waste their lives at home, with friendship such as thine<br> Sit idly by the poured-out juice.<br> 16 Giver of kine, may we not miss thy gracious gifts: let us not rob thee of thine own.<br> Strip even the strong places of the foe, and bring: thy gifts can never be made vain.<br> 17 Indra or blest Sarasvat&#299; alone bestows such wealth, treasure so great, or thou,<br> O Citra, on the worshipper.<br> 18 Citra is King, and only kinglings are the rest who dwell beside Sarasvat&#299;.<br> He, like Parjanya with his rain, hath spread himself with thousand, yea, with myriad gifts.</p>
