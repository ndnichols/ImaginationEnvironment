</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>For we know that  
if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of   
ELOHIYM, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>For in this we groan, earnestly 
desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>If so be that being clothed 
we shall not be found naked.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>    
4</H4></TD><TD><P>For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened:  
not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be   
swallowed up of life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is ELOHIYM, who also  
hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore we are always confident, knowing     
that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from YHVH:</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>(For we walk by faith, not  
by sight:)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>We  
are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be  
present with YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted 
of him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>For  
we must all appear before the judgment seat of MASHIYACH; that every one may    
receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it 
be good or bad.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD>
<P>Knowing therefore the terror of the ADONAY, we persuade men; but we are made 
manifest unto ELOHIYM; and I trust also are made manifest in your               
consciences.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>
For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on  
our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, 
and not in heart.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to ELOHIYM: or whether we be   
sober, it is for your cause.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>   
14</H4></TD><TD><P>For the love of MASHIYACH constraineth us; because we thus   
judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And that he died for all, that    
they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which  
died for them, and rose again.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4> 
16</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea,    
though we have known MASHIYACH after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him  
no more.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Therefore if any man be in MASHIYACH, he is a new creature: old things are      
passed away; behold, all things are become new.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And all things are of ELOHIYM, who hath      
reconciled us to himself by YAHSHUA MASHIYACH, and hath given to us the         
ministry of reconciliation;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>    
19</H4></TD><TD><P>To wit, that ELOHIYM was in MASHIYACH, reconciling the world 
unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto  
us the word of reconciliation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4> 
20</H4></TD><TD><P>Now then we are ambassadors for MASHIYACH, as though ELOHIYM 
did beseech you by us: we pray you in MASHIYACH's stead, be ye reconciled to    
ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>For 
he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the   
righteousness of ELOHIYM in him.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
