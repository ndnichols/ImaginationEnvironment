<p>1. O INDRA, Lord of Light, what joys thou broughtest from the Asuras,<br> Prosper therewith, O Maghavan, him who lauds that deed, and those whose grass is trimmed for thee.<br> 2 The unwasting share of steeds and kine which, Indra, thou hast fast secured,<br> Grant to the worshipper who presses Soma and gives guerdon, not unto the churl.<br> 3 The riteless, godless man who sleeps, O Indra, his unbroken steep,&#151;<br> May he by following his own devices die. Hide from him wealth that nourishes.<br> 4 Whether, O &#346;akra, thou be far, or, V&#7771;tra-slayer, near at hand,<br> Thence by heaven-reaching songs he who hath pressed the juice invites thee with thy long-maned Steeds.<br> 5 Whether thou art in heaven's bright sphere, or in the basin of the sea;<br> Whether, chief V&#7771;tra-slayer, in some place on earth, or in the firmament, approach.<br> 6 Thou Soma-drinker, Lord of Strength, beside our flowing Soma juice<br> Delight us with thy bounty rich in pleasantness, O Indra, with abundant wealth.<br> 7 O Indra, turn us not away: be the companion of our feast.<br> For thou art our protection, yea, thou art our kin: O Indra, turn us not away.<br> 8 Sit down with us, O Indra, sit beside the juice to drink the meath.<br> Show forth great favour to the Singer, Maghavan; Indra, with us, beside the juice.<br> 9 O Caster of the Stone, nor Gods nor mortals have attained to thee.<br> Thou in thy might surpassest all that hath been made: the Gods have not attained to thee.<br> 10 Of one accord they made and formed for kingship Indra, the Hero who in all encounters overcometh,<br> Most eminent for power, destroyer in the conflict, fierce and exceeding strong, stalwart and full of vigour.<br> 11 Bards joined in song to Indra so that he might drink the Soma juice,<br> The Lord of Light, that he whose laws stand fast might aid with power and with the help he gives.<br> 12 Tle holy sages form a ring, looking and singing to the Ram.<br> Inciters, full of vigour, not to he deceived, are with the chanters, nigh to bear.<br> 13 Loudly I call that Indra, Maghavan the Mighty, who evermore possesses power, ever resistless.<br> Holy, most liberal, may he lead us on to riches, and, Thunder-armed, make all our pathways pleasant for us.<br> 14 Thou knowest well, O &#346;akra, thou Most Potent, with thy strength, Indra, to destroy these castles.<br> Before thee, Thunder-armed! all beings tremble: the heavens and earth before thee shake with terror,<br> 15 May thy truth, Indra, Wondrous Hero be my guard: bear me o&#146;er much woe, Thunderer! as over floods.<br> When, Indra, wilt thou honour us with opulence, all-nourishing and much-to-be. desired, O King?</p>
