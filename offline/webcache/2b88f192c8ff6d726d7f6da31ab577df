NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>And the famine was sore in the land.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, when   
they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father    
said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did  
solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother 
be with you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>  
If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>But if thou wilt  
not send him, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see   
my face, except your brother be with you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with   
me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And they said, The man asked us     
straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive?    
have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: 
could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And Judah said unto    
Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may  
live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>I will be surety for him;   
of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him    
before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>For except we had lingered,       
surely now we had returned this second time.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And their father Israel said unto them, If it   
must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels,   
and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices,    
and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>  
12</H4></TD><TD><P>And take double money in your hand; and the money that was   
brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand;          
peradventure it was an oversight:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13>  
<H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the     
man:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And EL  
SHADDAY give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other         
brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And the men took     
that present, and they took double money in their hand and Benjamin; and rose   
up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And when Joseph saw Benjamin with 
them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and    
make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And the man did as Joseph bade;   
and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And the men were afraid, because  
they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that 
was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek 
occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our         
asses.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at  
the door of the house,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy       
food:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And it 
came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold,   
every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and   
we have brought it again in our hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And other money have we brought down in our     
hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, Peace be to  
you, fear not: your ELOHIYM, and the ELOHIYM of your father, hath given you     
treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto        
them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they      
washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And they made ready the present   
against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread          
there.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand     
into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And he asked them of their        
welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet 
alive?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And   
they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And he lifted up his eyes, and    
saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger      
brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, ELOHIYM be gracious unto thee,  
my son.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought     
where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And he washed his face,   
and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And they set on for him by    
himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with  
him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; 
for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And they sat before him, the firstborn       
according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the   
men marveled one at another.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>   
34</H4></TD><TD><P>And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but   
Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and    
were merry with him.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000
