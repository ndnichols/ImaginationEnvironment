<p>1. HEAVEN and earth trembled at the might and voice of him, whom, loved and Holy One, helper of all mankind,<br> The wise who longed for spoil in fight for kine brought forth with power, a Friend, mid waters, at the sacrifice.<br> 2 As these, like friends, have done this work for you, these prompt servants of Purum&#299;lha Soma-offerer,<br> Give mental power to him who sings the sacred song, and hearken, Strong Ones, to the master of the house.<br> 3 The folk have glorified your birth from Earth and Heaven, to be extolled, ye Strong Ones, for your mighty power.<br> Ye, when ye bring to singer and the rite, enjoy the sacrifice performed with holy praise and strength.<br> 4 The people prospers, Asuras! whom ye dearly love: ye, Righteous Ones, proclaim aloud the Holy Law.<br> That efficacious power that comes from lofty heaven, ye bind unto the work, as to the pole an ox.<br> 5 On this great earth ye send your treasure down with might: unstained by dust, the crowding kine are in the stalls.<br> Here in the neighbourhood they cry unto the Sun at morning and at evening, like swift birds of prey.<br> 6 The flames with curling tresses serve your sacrifice, whereto ye sing the song, Mitra and Varu&#7751;a.<br> Send down of your free will, prosper our holy songs: ye are sole Masters of the singer's hymn of praise.<br> 7 Whoso with sacrifices toiling brings you gifts, and worships, sage and priest, fulfilling your desire,&#151;<br> To him do ye draw nigh and taste his sacrifice. Come well-inclined to us unto our songs and prayer.<br> 8 With sacrifices and with milk they deck you first, ye Righteous Ones, as if through stirrings of the mind.<br> To you they bring their hymns with their collected thought, while ye with earnest soul come to us gloriously.<br> 9 Rich strength of life is yours: ye, Heroes, have obtained through your surpassing powers rich far-extending might.<br> Not the past days conjoined with nights, not rivers, not the Pa&#7751;is have attained your Godhead and your wealth.</p>
