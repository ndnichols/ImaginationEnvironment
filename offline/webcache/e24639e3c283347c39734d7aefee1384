Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have    
heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD           
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>For if the word spoken by angels    
was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just          
recompence of reward;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD>
<TD><P>How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the      
first began to be spoken by the ADONAY, and was confirmed unto us by them that  
heard him;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>    
ELOHIYM also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers 
miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>For unto the angels hath he 
not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>But one in a certain place          
testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man 
that thou visitest him?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him  
with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou hast put all      
things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under 
him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all      
things put under him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD>
<TD><P>But we see YAHSHUA, who was made a little lower than the angels for the  
suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of      
ELOHIYM should taste death for every man.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>For it became him, for whom are all things, and 
by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain   
of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>For both he that sanctifieth and they who    
are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them   
brethren,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church    
will I sing praise unto thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>  
13</H4></TD><TD><P>And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I   
and the children which YHVH hath given me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of 
flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through   
death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And deliver     
them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>For verily he   
took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of            
Abraham.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>    
Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that  
he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to         
ELOHIYM, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>For in that he himself hath   
suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.</P></TD>
