<p>1. WITH thee, O Agni, was this singer of the laud: he hath no other kinship, O thou Son of Strength.<br> Thou givest blessed shelter with a triple guard. Keep the destructive lightning far away from us.<br> 2 Thy birth who seekest food is in the falling flood, Agni: as Comrade thou winnest all living things.<br> Our coursers and our songs shall be victorious: they of themselves advance like one who guards the herd.<br> 3 And thou, O Agni, thou of Godlike nature, sparest the stones, while caring up the brushwood.<br> Then are thy tracks like deserts in the corn-lands. Let us not stir to wrath thy mighty arrow.<br> 4 O'er hills through vales devouring as thou goest, thou partest like an army fain for booty<br> As when a barber shaves a beard, thou shavest earth when the wind blows on thy flame and fans it.<br> 5 Apparent are his lines as he approaches the course is single, but the cars are many,<br> When, Agni, thou, making thine arms resplendent, advancest o&#146;er the land spread out beneath thee.<br> 6 Now let thy strength, thy burning flames fly upward, thine energies, O Agni, as thou toilest.<br> Gape widely, bend thee, waxing in thy vigour: let all the Vasus sit this day beside thee.<br> 7 This is the waters' reservoir, the great abode of gathered streams.<br> Take thou another path than this, and as thou listest walk thereon.<br> 8 On thy way hitherward and hence let flowery Durva grass spring up<br> Let there be lakes with lotus blooms. These are the mansions of the flood.</p>
