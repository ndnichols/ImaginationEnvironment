<p>1. ONE is a youth brown, active, manifold he decks the golden one with ornament.<br> 2 Another, luminous, occupies the place of sacritice, Sage, among the Gods.<br> 3 One brandishes in his hand an iron knife, firm, in his seat amid the Deities.<br> 4 Another holds the thunderbolt, wherewith he slays the V&#7771;tras, resting in his hand.<br> 5 Another bears a pointed weapon: bright is he, and strong, with healing medicines.<br> 6 Another, thief-like, watches well the ways, and knows the places where the treasures lie.<br> 7 Another with his mighty stride hath made his three steps thither where the Gods rejoice.<br> 8 Two with one Dame ride on with winged steeds, and journey forth like travellers on their way.<br> 9 Two, highest, in the heavens have set their seat, worshipped with holy oil, imperial Kings.<br> 10 Some, singing lauds, conceived the S&#257;ma-hymn, great hymn whereby they caused the Sun to shine.</p>
