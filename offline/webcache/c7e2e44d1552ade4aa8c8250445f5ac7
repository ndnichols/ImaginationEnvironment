VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>Paul, an apostle, (not of men,      
neither by man, but by YAHSHUA MASHIYACH, and ELOHIYM the Father, who raised    
him from the dead;)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Grace be to you   
and peace from ELOHIYM the Father, and from our ADONAY YAHSHUA MASHIYACH,</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Who gave himself  
for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according  
to the will of ELOHIYM and our Father:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>I marvel that ye are   
so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of MASHIYACH unto       
another gospel:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert  
the gospel of MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel     
unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>As we said        
before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel unto you than    
that ye have received, let him be accursed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>For do I now persuade men, or ELOHIYM? or do I  
seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of    
MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>  
But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not    
after man.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>  
For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the           
revelation of YAHSHUA MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13>   
<H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the 
Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of ELOHIYM, and 
wasted it:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation,     
being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>But when it pleased       
ELOHIYM, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>To reveal his   
Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred   
not with flesh and blood:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>      
17</H4></TD><TD><P>Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles   
before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Then after three     
years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>But other of    
the apostles saw I none, save James the ADONAY's brother.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Now the things which I write unto 
you, behold, before ELOHIYM, I lie not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and 
Cilicia;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in MASHIYACH:</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>But they had    
heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith   
which once he destroyed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And they glorified ELOHIYM in me.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This
