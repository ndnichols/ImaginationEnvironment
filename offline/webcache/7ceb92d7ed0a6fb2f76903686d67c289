charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>For he that speaketh   
in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto ELOHIYM: for no man        
understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>But he that prophesieth     
speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>He that speaketh in an      
unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the           
church.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>I      
would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied: for greater 
is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, 
that the church may receive edifying.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with   
tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by         
revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And even things without     
life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the  
sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>For if the trumpet give an          
uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>So likewise ye, except ye utter by  
the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken?   
for ye shall speak into the air.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10>   
<H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the     
world, and none of them is without signification.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore if I know not the       
meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he     
that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of      
spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore let him    
that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>For if I pray in an unknown   
tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>What is it then? I will pray  
with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with  
the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Else when thou shalt bless with   
the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at   
thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>For thou verily      
givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>I thank my ELOHIYM, I speak with  
tongues more than ye all:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>      
19</H4></TD><TD><P>Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my      
understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand    
words in an unknown tongue.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>    
20</H4></TD><TD><P>Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in       
malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>In the law it is written, With    
men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for  
all that will they not hear me, saith YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them   
that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for     
them that believe not, but for them which believe.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>If therefore the whole church be  
come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in     
those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>But if all      
prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is     
convinced of all, he is judged of all:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And thus are the secrets of his heart made      
manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship ELOHIYM, and report   
that EL is in you of a truth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>  
26</H4></TD><TD><P>How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one   
of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an 
interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>If any man speak in an unknown    
tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let  
one interpret.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let  
him speak to himself, and to ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Let the prophets speak two or three, and let    
the other judge.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold  
his peace.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>  
For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be          
comforted.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>For ELOHIYM is not the author 
of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>Let your women keep silence   
in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are       
commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And if they will learn any thing, 
let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in    
the church.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P> 
What? came the word of ELOHIYM out from you? or came it unto you only?</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>If any man think     
himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that

<A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>But if any man be ignorant, let him be       
ignorant.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with            
tongues.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>Let
