<p>1. I TRIM like grass my song for the N&#257;satyas and send their lauds forth as the wind drives rain-clouds,<br> Who, in a chariot rapid as an arrow, brought to the youthful Vimada a consort.<br> 2 Borne on by rapid steeds of mighty pinion, or proudly trusting in the Gods&#146; incitements.<br> That stallion ass of yours won, O N&#257;satyas, that thousand in the race, in Yama's contest.<br> 3 Yea, A&#347;vins, as a dead man leaves his riches, Tugra left Bhujyu in the cloud of waters.<br> Ye brought him back in animated vessels, traversing air, unwetted by the billows.<br> 4 Bhujyu ye bore with winged things, N&#257;satyas, which for three nights, three days full swiftly travelled,<br> To the sea's farther shore, the strand of ocean, in three cars, hundred-footed, with six horses.<br> 5 Ye wrought that hero exploit in the ocean which giveth no support, or hold or station,<br> What time ye carried Bhujyu to his dwelling, borne in a ship with hundred oars, O A&#347;vins.<br> 6 The white horse which of old ye gave Agh&#257;&#347;va, A&#347;vins, a gift to be his wealth for ever,&#151;<br> Still to be praised is that your glorious present, still to be famed is the brave horse of Pedu.<br> 7 O Heroes, ye gave wisdom to Kak&#7779;&#299;v&#257;n who sprang from Pajra's line, who sang your praises.<br> Ye poured forth from the hoof of your strong charger a hundred jars of wine as from a strainer.<br> 8 Ye warded off with cold the fire's fierce burning; food very rich in nourishment ye furnished.<br> Atri, cast downward in the cavern, A&#347;vins ye brought, with all his people, forth to comfort.<br> 9 Ye lifted up the well, O ye N&#257;satyas, and set the base on high to open downward.<br> Streams flowed for folk of Gotama who thirsted, like rain to bring forth thousandfold abundance.<br> 10 Ye from the old Cyav&#257;na, O N&#257;satyas, stripped, as &#146;twere mail, the skin upon<br> his body,<br> Lengthened his life when all had left him helpless, Dasras! and made him lord of youthful maidens.<br> 11 Worthy of praise and worth the winning, Heroes, is that your favouring succour O N&#257;satyas,<br> What time ye, knowing well his case, delivered Vandana from the pit like hidden treasure.<br> 12 That mighty deed of yours, for gain, O Heroes, as thunder heraldeth the rain, I publish,<br> When, by the horse's head, Atharvan's offspring Dadhyac made known to you the Soma's sweetness.<br> 13 In the great rite the wise dame called, N&#257;satyas, you, Lords of many treasures, to assist her.<br> Ye heard the weakling's wife, as &#146;twere an order, and gave to her a son Hira&#7751;yahasta.<br> 14 Ye from the wolf's jaws, as ye stood together, set free the quail, O Heroes, O N&#257;satyas.<br> Ye, Lords of many treasures, gave the poet his perfect vision as he mourned his trouble.<br> 15 When in the time of night, in Khela's battle, a leg was severed like a wild bird's pinion,<br> Straight ye gave Vi&#347;pal&#257; a leg of iron that she might move what time the conflict opened.<br> 16 His father robbed &#7770;jr&#257;&#347;va of his eyesight who for the she-wolf slew a hundred wethers.<br> Ye gave him eyes, N&#257;satyas, Wonder-Workers, Physicians, that he saw with sight uninjured.<br> 17 The Daughter of the Sun your car ascended, first reaching as it were the goal with coursers.<br> All Deities within their hearts assented, and ye, N&#257;satyas, are close linked with glory.<br> 18 When to his house ye came, to Divod&#257;sa, hasting to Bharadv&#257;ja, O ye A&#347;vins,<br> The car that came with you brought splendid riches: a porpoise and a bull were yoked together.<br> 19 Ye, bringing wealth with rule, and life with offspring, life rich in noble heroes; O N&#257;satyas,<br> Accordant came with strength to Jahnu's children who offered you thrice every day your portion.<br> 20 Ye bore away at night by easy pathways J&#257;hu&#7779;a compassed round on every quarter,<br> And, with your car that cleaves the toe asunder, N&#257;satyas never decaying! rent the mountains.<br> 21 One morn ye strengthened Va&#347;a for the battle, to gather spoils that might be told in thousands.<br> With Indra joined ye drove away misfortunes, yea foes of P&#7771;thu&#347;ravas, O ye mighty.<br> 22 From the deep well ye raised on high the water, so that &#7770;catka's son, Sara, should drink it;<br> And with your might, to help the weary &#346;ayu, ye made the barren cow yield milk, N&#257;satyas.<br> 23 To Vi&#347;vaka, N&#257;satyas! son of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the righteous man who sought your aid and praised you,<br> Ye with your powers restored, like some lost creature, his son Vi&#7779;&#7751;&#257;p&#363; for his eyes to look on.<br> 24 A&#347;vins, ye raised, like Soma in a ladle Rebha, who for ten days and ten nights, fettered.<br> Had lain in cruel bonds, immersed and wounded, suffering sore affliction, in the waters.<br> 25 1 have declared your wondrous deeds, O A&#347;vins: may this be mine, and many kine and heroes.<br> May I, enjoying lengthened life, still seeing, enter old age as &#146;twere the house I live in.</p>
