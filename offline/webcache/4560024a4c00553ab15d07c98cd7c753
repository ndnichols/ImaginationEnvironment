<p>1. E'EN to the wise let that be still a wonder to which the general name of Cow is given.<br> The one hath swelled among mankind for milking: P&#7771;&#347;ni hath drained but once her fair bright udder.<br> 2 They who like kindled flames of fire are glowing,. the Maruts, twice and thrice have waxen mighty.<br> Golden and dustless were their cars, invested with their great strength and their heroic vigour.<br> 3 They who are Sons of the rain-pouring Rudra, whom the long-lasting One had power to foster:<br> The Mighty Ones whose germ great Mother P&#7771;&#347;ni is known to have received for man's advantage.<br> 4 They shrink not from the birth; in this same manner still resting there they purge away reproaches.<br> When they have streamed forth, brilliant, at their pleasure, with their own splendour they bedew their bodies.<br> 5 Even those who bear the brave bold name of Maruts, whom not the active quickly wins for milking.<br> Even the liberal wards not off those fierce ones, those who are light and agile in their greatness.<br> 6 When, strong in strength and armed with potent weapons, they had united wellformed earth and heaven,<br> Rodasl stood among these furious Heroes like splendour shining with her native brightness.<br> 7 No team of goats shall draw your car, O Maruts, no horse no charioteer be he who drives it.<br> Halting not, reinless, through the air it travels, speeding alone its paths through earth and heaven.<br> 8 None may obstruct, none overtake, O Maruts, him whom ye succour in the strife of battle<br> For sons and progeny, for kine and waters: he bursts the cow-stall on the day of trial.<br> 9 Bring a bright hymn to praise the band of Maruts, the Singers, rapid, strong in native vigour,<br> Who conquer mighty strength with strength more mighty: earth shakes in terror at their wars, O Agni.<br> 10 Bright like the flashing flames of sacrifices, like tongues of fire impetuous in their onset,<br> Chanting their psalm, singing aloud, like heroes, splendid from birth, invincible, the Maruts.<br> 11 That swelling band I call with invocation, the brood of Rudra, armed with glittering lances.<br> Pure hymns are meet for that celestial army: like floods and mountains have the Strong Ones battled.</p>
