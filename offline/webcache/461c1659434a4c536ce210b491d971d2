<p>1. I TRAVEL with the Rudras and the Vasus, with the &#256;dityas and All-Gods I wander.<br> I hold aloft both Varu&#7751;a and Mitra, Indra and Agni, and the Pair of A&#347;vins.<br> 2 I cherish and sustain high-swelling Soma, and Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar I support, P&#363;&#7779;an, and Bhaga.<br> I load with wealth the zealous sdcrificer who pours the juice and offers his oblation<br> 3 I am the Queen, the gatherer-up of treasures, most thoughtful, first of those who merit worship.<br> Thus Gods have stablished me in many places with many homes to enter and abide in.<br> 4 Through me alone all eat the food that feeds them,&#151;each man who sees, brewhes, hears the word outspoken<br> They know it not, but yet they dwell beside me. Hear, one and all, the truth as I declare it.<br> 5 1, verily, myself announce and utter the word that Gods and men alike shall welcome.<br> I make the man I love exceeding mighty, make him a sage, a &#7770;&#7779;i, and a Brahman.<br> 6 I bend the bow for Rudra that his arrow may strike and slay the hater of devotion.<br> I rouse and order battle for the people, and I have penetrated Earth and Heaven.<br> 7 On the world's summit I bring forth the Father: my home is in the waters, in the ocean.<br> Thence I extend o&#146;er all existing creatures, and touch even yonder heaven with my forehead.<br> 8 I breathe a strong breath like the wind and tempest, the while I hold together all existence.<br> Beyond this wide earth and beyond the heavens I have become so mighty in my grandeur.</p>
