1</H4></TD><TD><P>Woe to the rebellious children, saith YHVH, that take         
counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit,   
that they may add sin to sin:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>   
2</H4></TD><TD><P>That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my     
mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the 
shadow of Egypt!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust in the  
shadow of Egypt your confusion.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4> 
4</H4></TD><TD><P>For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to     
Hanes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>They    
were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them, nor be an help nor     
profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>The burden of the beasts of the south: into the   
land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the young and old lion, the viper 
and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of    
young asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people that   
shall not profit them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore  
have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit still.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Now go, write it before them in 
a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever    
and ever:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>That 
this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the    
law of YHVH:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>
Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us      
right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits:</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Get you out of the way, turn  
aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore thus  
saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in        
oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a 
breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh        
suddenly at an instant.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel that   
is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in    
the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth, or to take water       
withal out of the pit.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>For thus saith the ADONAY YHVH, the Holy One of Israel; In          
returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be   
your strength: and ye would not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16>   
<H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore 
shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that      
pursue you be swift.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five 
shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as   
an ensign on an hill.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>And therefore will YHVH wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and 
therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for YHVH is a    
ELOHIYM of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him.</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>For the people shall dwell in 
Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt weep no more: he will be very gracious unto thee  
at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And though the       
ADONAY give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet shall  
not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see    
thy teachers:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk  
ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye shall defile also 
the covering of thy graven images of silver, and the ornament of thy molten     
images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say 
unto it, Get thee hence.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4>
</TD><TD><P>Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the    
ground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be fat and  
plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>The oxen likewise and the 
young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender, which hath been      
winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And there shall be upon every high mountain,    
and upon every high hill, rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great  
slaughter, when the towers fall.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26>   
<H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of  
the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven     
days, in the day that YHVH bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the 
stroke of their wound.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>Behold, the name of YHVH cometh from far, burning with his anger,   
and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of indignation, and his      
tongue as a devouring fire:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>    
28</H4></TD><TD><P>And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the 
midst of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and there      
shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to err.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye shall have a song, as  
in the night when a holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one  
goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of YHVH, to the mighty One of       
Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
YHVH shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall shew the lighting    
down of his arm, with the indignation of his anger, and with the flame of a     
devouring fire, with scattering, and tempest, and hailstones.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>For through the voice of YHVH 
shall the Assyrian be beaten down, which smote with a rod.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And in every place where the      
grounded staff shall pass, which YHVH shall lay upon him, it shall be with      
tabrets and harps: and in battles of shaking will he fight with it.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>For Tophet is        
ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared; he hath made it deep and     
large: the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of YHVH, like a       
stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
