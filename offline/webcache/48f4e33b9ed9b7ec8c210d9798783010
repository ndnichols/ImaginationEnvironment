VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>Paul and Timotheus, the servants of 
YAHSHUA MASHIYACH, to all the saints in MASHIYACH YAHSHUA which are at          
Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Grace be unto you, and peace, from ELOHIYM our    
Father, and from the ADONAY YAHSHUA MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>I thank my ELOHIYM upon every remembrance of   
you,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Always in 
every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>For your fellowship in the gospel   
from the first day until now;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>   
6</H4></TD><TD><P>Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun  
a good work in you will perform it until the day of YAHSHUA MASHIYACH:</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Even as it is meet for 
me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both   
in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are      
partakers of my grace.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>For ELOHIYM is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the   
bowels of YAHSHUA MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>    
9</H4></TD><TD><P>And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more  
in knowledge and in all judgment;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10>  
<H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye   
may be sincere and without offence till the day of MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Being filled with the fruits  
of righteousness, which are by YAHSHUA MASHIYACH, unto the glory and praise of  
ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>But 
I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me  
have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>So that my bonds in MASHIYACH are 
manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And many of the brethren in the   
ADONAY, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word      
without fear.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>Some indeed preach MASHIYACH even of envy and strife; and some also of good  
will:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>The    
one preach MASHIYACH of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction  
to my bonds:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>
But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>What then?      
notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, MASHIYACH is      
preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>For I know that this shall turn   
to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of YAHSHUA    
MASHIYACH,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>  
According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be     
ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also MASHIYACH shall be  
magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>For to me to live is MASHIYACH,   
and to die is gain.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD>
<TD><P>But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I   
shall choose I wot not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to 
be with MASHIYACH; which is far better:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more      
needful for you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD>   
<TD><P>And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with  
you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>That your rejoicing may be more abundant in  
YAHSHUA MASHIYACH for me by my coming to you again.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>Only let your conversation be as  
it becometh the gospel of MASHIYACH: that whether I come and see you, or else   
be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with   
one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And in nothing terrified by your  
adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of      
salvation, and that of ELOHIYM.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>
29</H4></TD><TD><P>For unto you it is given in the behalf of MASHIYACH, not     
only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>Having the same conflict which ye 
saw in me, and now hear to be in me.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
