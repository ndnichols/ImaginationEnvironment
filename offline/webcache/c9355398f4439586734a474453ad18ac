<p>1. MAGHAVAN Indra turns his chariot downward, the strength-displaying car which he hath mounted.<br> Even as a herdsman driveth forth his cattle, he goeth, first, uninjured, fain for treasure.<br> 2. Haste to us, Lord of Bays; be not ungracious: visit us, lover of gold-hued oblation.<br> There is naught else better than thou art, Indra: e&#146;en to the wifeless hast thou given spouses.<br> 3 When out of strength arose the strength that conquers, Indra displayed all powers that he possesses.<br> Forth from the cave he drove the milky mothers, and with the light laid bare investing darkness.<br> 4. Anus have wrought a chariot for thy Courser, and Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar, Much-invoked! thy bolt that glitters.<br> The Brahmans with their songs exalting Indra increased his strength that he might slaughter Ahi.<br> 5 When heroes sang their laud to thee the Hero, Indra! and stones and Aditi accordant,<br> Without or steed or chariot were the fellies which, sped by Indra, rolled upon the Dasytis.<br> 6 I will declare thine exploits wrought aforetime, and, Maghavan, thy deeds of late achievement,<br> When, Lord of Might, thou sunderedst earth and heaven, winning for man the moistly-gleaming waters.<br> 7 This is thy deed, e&#146;en this, Wonderful! Singer! that, slaying Ahi, here thy strength thou showedst,<br> Didst check and stay e&#146;en gusna's wiles and magic, and, drawing nigh, didst chase away the Dasytis.<br> 8 Thou, Indra, on the farther bank forYadu and Turvaga didst stay the gushing waters.<br> Ye both assailed the fierce: thou barest Kutsa: when Gods and U&#347;an&#257; came to you together.<br> 9 Let the steeds bring you both, Indra and Kutsa, borne on the chariot within hearing-distance.<br> Ye blew him from the waters, from his dwelling, and chased the darkness from the noble's spirit.<br> 10 Even this sage hath come looking for succour even to V&#257;ta's docile harnessed horses.<br> Here are the Maruts, all, thy dear companions: prayers have increased thy power and might, O Indra.<br> 11 When night was near its close he carried forward e&#146;en the Sun's chariot backward in its running.<br> Etaga brought his wheel and firmly stays it: setting it eastward he shall give us courage.<br> 12 This Indra, O ye men, hath come to see you, seeking a friend who hath expressed the Soma.<br> The creaking stone is laid upon the altar, and the Adhvaryus come to turn it quickly.<br> 13 Let mortals who were happy still be happy; let them not come to sorrow, O Immortal.<br> Love thou the pious, and to these thy people-with whom may we be numbered-give thou vigour.</p>
