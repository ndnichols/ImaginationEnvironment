Chapter 11</H1></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he 
ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, ADONAY, teach us to pray, as John   
also taught his disciples.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in   
heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, 
so in earth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Give us day by day our daily bread.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4> 
<H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one    
that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from    
evil.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And he   
said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at      
midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>For a friend of mine in his journey 
is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And he from within shall answer and 
say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed;  
I cannot rise and give thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>    
8</H4></TD><TD><P>I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because 
he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as   
many as he needeth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall   
find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>For every one that asketh receiveth; and he  
that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>If a son shall ask bread  
of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish,  
will he for a fish give him a serpent?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a  
scorpion?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>If 
ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much   
more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And he was      
casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was   
gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>But some of them said, He casteth 
out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And others, tempting him, sought  
of him a sign from heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>     
17</H4></TD><TD><P>But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every        
kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided    
against a house falleth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4>
</TD><TD><P>If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom     
stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And if I by Beelzebub     
cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be    
your judges.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>
But if I with the finger of ELOHIYM cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of EL 
is come upon you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace:</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>But when a      
stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all  
his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>He that is not with me is against 
me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>When the unclean spirit is gone   
out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he 
saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he cometh, he findeth it 
swept and garnished.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked    
than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that    
man is worse than the first.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>   
27</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain     
woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the     
womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>But he said, Yea rather, blessed  
are they that hear the word of ELOHIYM, and keep it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD       
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the people were gathered 
thick together, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign;  
and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>For as Jonas was a   
sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>The queen of    
the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and    
condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the       
wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>The men of Nineve shall   
rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they    
repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is        
here.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>No     
man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place, neither under 
a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light.</P>  
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>The light of    
the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is 
full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of             
darkness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>   
Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>If thy whole body    
therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of     
light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light.</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And as he spake, a   
certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to 
meat.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first washed before      
dinner.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
the ADONAY said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup 
and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye fools, did   
not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>But rather give alms 
of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>But woe unto you,    
Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over     
judgment and the love of ELOHIYM: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave 
the other undone.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the          
synagogues, and greetings in the markets.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees,            
hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over   
them are not aware of them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V45><H4>    
45</H4></TD><TD><P>Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, 
thus saying thou reproachest us also.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V46><H4>46</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for 
ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the  
burdens with one of your fingers.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47>  
<H4>47</H4></TD><TD><P>Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the         
prophets, and your fathers killed them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V48><H4>48</H4></TD><TD><P>Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds   
of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V49><H4>49</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore also  
said the wisdom of ELOHIYM, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of 
them they shall slay and persecute:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V50>
<H4>50</H4></TD><TD><P>That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from  
the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V51><H4>51</H4></TD><TD><P>From the blood of Abel    
unto the blood of Zacharias which perished between the altar and the temple:    
verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this generation.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V52><H4>52</H4></TD><TD><P>Woe unto you, lawyers!    
for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and  
them that were entering in ye hindered.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V53><H4>53</H4></TD><TD><P>And as he said these things unto them, the      
scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to   
speak of many things:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V54><H4>54</H4>   
</TD><TD><P>Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his      
mouth, that they might accuse him.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
