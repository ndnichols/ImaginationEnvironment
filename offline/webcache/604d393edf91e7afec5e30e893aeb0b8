<p>1. RAISING his voice the King hath flowed upon his way: invested with the waters he would win the kine.<br> The fleece retains his solid parts as though impure, and bright and cleansed he seeks the special place of Gods.<br> 2 Thou, Soma, art effused for Indra by the men, balmed in the wood as wave, Sage, Viewer of mankind.<br> Full many are the paths whereon thou mayest go: a thousand bay steeds hast thou resting in the bowls.<br> 3 Apsarases who dwell in waters of the sea, sitting within, have flowed to Soma wise of heart.<br> They urge the Master of the house upon his way, and to the Eternal Pavamana pray for bliss.<br> 4 Soma flows on for u's as winner of the kine, winner of thousands, cars, water, and light, and gold;<br> He whom the Gods have made a gladdening draught to drink, the drop most sweet to taste, weal-bringing, red of hue.<br> 5 Soma, as Pavamana thou, our faithful Friend, making for us these real treasures, flowest on.<br> Slay thou the enemy both near and,far away: grant us security and ample pasturage.</p>
