<p>1. How shall we pay oblation unto Agni? What hymn, Godloved, is said to him refulgent?<br> Who, deathless, true to Law, mid men a herald, bringeth the Gods as best of sacrificers?<br> 2 Bring him with reverence hither, most propitious in sacrifices, true to Law, the herald;<br> For Agni, when he seeks the Gods for mortals, knows them full well and worships them in spirit.<br> 3 For he is mental power, a man, and perfect; he is the bringer, friend-like, of the wondrous.<br> The pious &#256;ryan tribes at sacrifices address them first to him who doeth marvels.<br> 4 May Agni, foe-destroyer, manliest Hero, accept with love our hymns and our devotion.<br> So may the liberal lords whose strength is strongest, urged by their riches, stir our thoughts with vigour.<br> 5 Thus Agni J&#257;tavedas, true to Order, hath by the priestly Gotamas been lauded.<br> May he augment in them splendour and vigour: observant, as he lists, he gathers increase.</p>
