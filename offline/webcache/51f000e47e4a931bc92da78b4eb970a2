1</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first day of 
the month, that the word of YHVH came unto me, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Son of man, because that Tyrus hath 
said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken that was the gates of the people:    
she is turned unto me: I shall be replenished, now she is laid waste:</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore thus saith   
the ADONAY YHVH; Behold, I am against thee, O Tyrus, and will cause many        
nations to come up against thee, as the sea causeth his waves to come up.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And they shall    
destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her   
dust from her, and make her like the top of a rock.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>It shall be a place for the         
spreading of nets in the midst of the sea: for I have spoken it, saith the      
ADONAY YHVH: and it shall become a spoil to the nations.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And her daughters which are in the  
field shall be slain by the sword; and they shall know that I am YHVH.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>For thus saith the     
ADONAY YHVH; Behold, I will bring upon Tyrus Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a  
king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with         
horsemen, and companies, and much people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the 
field: and he shall make a fort against thee, and cast a mount against thee,    
and lift up the buckler against thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And he shall set engines of war against thy       
walls, and with his axes he shall break down thy towers.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>By reason of the abundance of his 
horses their dust shall cover thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the   
horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into thy  
gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>With the hoofs of his horses      
shall he tread down all thy streets: he shall slay thy people by the sword, and 
thy strong garrisons shall go down to the ground.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD          
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And they shall make a spoil of    
thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise: and they shall break down thy   
walls, and destroy thy pleasant houses: and they shall lay thy stones and thy   
timber and thy dust in the midst of the water.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will cause the noise of thy songs to   
cease; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will make thee like the top 
of a rock: thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no    
more: for I YHVH have spoken it, saith the ADONAY YHVH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus saith the ADONAY YHVH to     
Tyrus; Shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded     
cry, when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD      
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Then all the princes of the sea   
shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their 
broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit 
upon the ground, and shall tremble at every moment, and be astonished at        
thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And    
they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to thee, How art thou        
destroyed, that wast inhabited of seafaring men, the renowned city, which wast  
strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, which cause their terror to be on   
all that haunt it!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that  
are in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>For thus saith the ADONAY YHVH;   
When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; 
when I shall bring up the deep upon thee, and great waters shall cover thee;</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>When I shall    
bring thee down with them that descend into the pit, with the people of old     
time, and shall set thee in the low parts of the earth, in places desolate of   
old, with them that go down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I shall 
set glory in the land of the living;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A         
NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>I will make thee a terror, and thou shalt be no 
more: though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith the 
ADONAY YHVH.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John
