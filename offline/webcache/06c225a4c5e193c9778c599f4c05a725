<TD><P>And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from     
Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>(And this taxing was first made     
when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A        
NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And all went to be taxed, every one into his own  
city.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And      
Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea,     
unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house 
and lineage of David:)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And so it was,    
that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be      
delivered.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and  
laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.</P></TD>   
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And there were in the  
same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by  
night.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And,    
lo, the angel of YHVH came upon them, and the glory of the ELOHIYM shone round  
about them: and they were sore afraid.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for,    
behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>For unto you is 
born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is MASHIYACH the ADONAY.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And this shall  
be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying  
in a manger.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>
And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising 
ELOHIYM, and saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Glory to ELOHIYM in the highest, and on earth peace, good will      
toward men.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the    
shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this  
thing which is come to pass, which YHVH hath made known unto us.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And they came with haste, 
and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they had seen it,    
they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.</P>
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And all they    
that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the              
shepherds.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>  
But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.</P></TD></TR>   
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And the shepherds         
returned, glorifying and praising ELOHIYM for all the things that they had      
heard and seen, as it was told unto them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A    
NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And when eight days were accomplished for the   
circumcising of the child, his name was called YAHSHUA, which was so named of   
the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the days of her purification        
according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, 
to present him to YHVH;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>(As it is written in the law of YHVH, Every male that openeth the   
womb shall be called holy to YHVH;)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24>
<H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said 
in the law of YHVH, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And, behold, there was a  
man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout,  
waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And it was revealed  
unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen    
YHVH's MASHIYACH.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought  
in the child YAHSHUA, to do for him after the custom of the law,</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Then took he him up in    
his arms, and blessed ELOHIYM, and said,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A     
NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>YHVH, now lettest thou thy servant depart in    
peace, according to thy word:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>  
30</H4></TD><TD><P>For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD  
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>Which thou hast prepared before   
the face of all people;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people        
Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And  
Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>And Simeon      
blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the  
fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken   
against;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>    
(Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of     
many hearts may be revealed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>   
36</H4></TD><TD><P>And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of        
Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an    
husband seven years from her virginity;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>And she was a widow of about fourscore and four 
years, which departed not from the temple, but served with fastings and prayers 
night and day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V38><H4>38</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto YHVH, and spake of  
him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD   
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V39><H4>39</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they had performed all   
things according to the law of YHVH, they returned into Galilee, to their own   
city Nazareth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the  
grace of ELOHIYM was upon him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4> 
41</H4></TD><TD><P>Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of 
the passover.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom 
of the feast.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child YAHSHUA    
tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>But they, supposing  
him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him      
among their kinsfolk and acquaintance.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A       
NAME=V45><H4>45</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they found him not, they turned back   
again to Jerusalem, seeking him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V46>   
<H4>46</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, that after three days they found    
him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and  
asking them questions.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V47><H4>47</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and     
answers.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V48><H4>48</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why     
hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee         
sorrowing.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V49><H4>49</H4></TD><TD><P>  
And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be  
about my Father's business?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V50><H4>    
50</H4></TD><TD><P>And they understood not the saying which he spake unto       
them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V51><H4>51</H4></TD><TD><P>And he 
went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his   
mother kept all these sayings in her heart.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A  
NAME=V52><H4>52</H4></TD><TD><P>And YAHSHUA increased in wisdom and stature,    
and in favour with ELOHIYM and man.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is
