NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass after these things, that the  
butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of   
Egypt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And     
Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the         
butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>  
<A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And he put them in ward in the house of the    
captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And the captain   
of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a 
season in ward.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD>  
<P>And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each 
man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of   
the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD         
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And Joseph came in unto them in the 
morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And he asked Pharaoh's officers     
that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye   
so sadly to day?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD> 
<P>And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter 
of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to ELOHIYM?     
tell me them, I pray you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In  
my dream, behold, a vine was before me;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A      
NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And in the vine were three branches: and it was 
as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof      
brought forth ripe grapes:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>     
11</H4></TD><TD><P>And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and 
pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And Joseph said 
unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three        
days:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Yet    
within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy   
place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former     
manner when thou wast his butler.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14>  
<H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and     
show kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and   
bring me out of this house:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>    
15</H4></TD><TD><P>For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: 
and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>When the chief  
baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in  
my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head:</P></TD></TR><TR>  
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And in the uppermost basket   
there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them    
out of the basket upon my head.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>
18</H4></TD><TD><P>And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation     
thereof: The three baskets are three days:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy 
head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy  
flesh from off thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday,    
that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the    
chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD    
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And he restored the chief butler  
unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:</P></TD>    
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>But he hanged the    
chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Yet did not the chief butler remember        
Joseph, but forgat him.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright
