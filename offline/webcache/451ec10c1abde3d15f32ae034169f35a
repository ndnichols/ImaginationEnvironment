Chapter 9</H1></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD>  
<TD><P>In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the     
Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;</P></TD></TR><TR>   
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>In the first year of his reign  
I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of YHVH  
came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the     
desolations of Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>And I set my face unto the ADONAY ELOHIYM, to seek by prayer and    
supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD     
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And I prayed unto YHVH my ELOHIYM,  
and made my confession, and said, O ADONAY, the great and dreadful EL, keeping  
the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his         
commandments;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P> 
We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have   
rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments:</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Neither have we        
hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which spake in thy name to our kings, 
our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.</P></TD></TR>  
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>O ADONAY, righteousness     
belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men 
of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are    
near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven  
them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>O ADONAY, to us        
belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers,  
because we have sinned against thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9>
<H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>To the ADONAY our ELOHIYM belong mercies and              
forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD        
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Neither have we obeyed the voice  
of YHVH our ELOHIYM, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his         
servants the prophets.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4>  
</TD><TD><P>Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that  
they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the   
oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of ELOHIYM, because we     
have sinned against him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4>
</TD><TD><P>And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and     
against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under  
the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem.</P></TD>  
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>As it is written in  
the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet made we not our prayer     
before YHVH our ELOHIYM, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand 
thy truth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>  
Therefore hath YHVH watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us: for YHVH our 
ELOHIYM is righteous in all his works which he doeth: for we obeyed not his     
voice.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And   
now, O ADONAY our ELOHIYM, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land   
of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day; we    
have sinned, we have done wickedly.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16>
<H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>O ADONAY, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech  
thee, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy  
holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers,     
Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us.</P>    
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Now therefore,  
O our ELOHIYM, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause 
thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the ADONAY's         
sake.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>O my   
ELOHIYM, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our           
desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present    
our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great        
mercies.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>O   
ADONAY, hear; O ADONAY, forgive; O ADONAY, hearken and do; defer not, for thine 
own sake, O my ELOHIYM: for thy city and thy people are called by thy name.</P> 
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And whiles I    
was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people       
Israel, and presenting my supplication before YHVH my ELOHIYM for the holy      
mountain of my ELOHIYM;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4> 
</TD><TD><P>Yea, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I  
had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched   
me about the time of the evening oblation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And he informed me, and talked with me, and     
said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding.</P>   
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>At the          
beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to     
shew thee; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and   
consider the vision.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4>    
</TD><TD><P>Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy      
city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make      
reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to  
seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Know therefore and            
understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to      
build Jerusalem unto the MASHIYACH the Prince shall be seven weeks, and         
threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even   
in troublous times.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And after threescore and two weeks shall MASHIYACH be cut off, but not   
for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the     
city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the 
end of the war desolations are determined.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A   
NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And he shall confirm the covenant with many for 
one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the     
oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it   
desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon 
the desolate.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--This Software is copyright 2000 by John
